<div data-type="abstract" markdown="1">
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Describe the bones that articulate together to form selected synovial
  joints
* Discuss the movements available at each joint
* Describe the structures that support and prevent excess movements at
  each joint

</div>
Each synovial joint of the body is specialized to perform certain
movements. The movements that are allowed are determined by the
structural classification for each joint. For example, a multiaxial
ball-and-socket joint has much more mobility than a uniaxial hinge
joint. However, the ligaments and muscles that support a joint may place
restrictions on the total range of motion available. Thus, the
ball-and-socket joint of the shoulder has little in the way of ligament
support, which gives the shoulder a very large range of motion. In
contrast, movements at the hip joint are restricted by strong ligaments,
which reduce its range of motion but confer stability during standing
and weight bearing.
{: #fs-id1472114}

This section will examine the anatomy of selected synovial joints of the
body. Anatomical names for most joints are derived from the names of the
bones that articulate at that joint, although some joints, such as the
elbow, hip, and knee joints are exceptions to this general naming
scheme.

# Articulations of the Vertebral Column
{: data-type="title"}

In addition to being held together by the intervertebral discs, adjacent
vertebrae also articulate with each other at synovial joints formed
between the superior and inferior articular processes called <span
data-type="term">zygapophysial joints</span> (facet joints) (see
[\[link\]](/m46383#fig-ch09_01_02){: .autogenerated-content}). These are
plane joints that provide for only limited motions between the
vertebrae. The orientation of the articular processes at these joints
varies in different regions of the vertebral column and serves to
determine the types of motions available in each vertebral region. The
cervical and lumbar regions have the greatest ranges of motions.
{: #fs-id1933550}

In the neck, the articular processes of cervical vertebrae are flattened
and generally face upward or downward. This orientation provides the
cervical vertebral column with extensive ranges of motion for flexion,
extension, lateral flexion, and rotation. In the thoracic region, the
downward projecting and overlapping spinous processes, along with the
attached thoracic cage, greatly limit flexion, extension, and lateral
flexion. However, the flattened and vertically positioned thoracic
articular processes allow for the greatest range of rotation within the
vertebral column. The lumbar region allows for considerable extension,
flexion, and lateral flexion, but the orientation of the articular
processes largely prohibits rotation.
{: #fs-id1966899}

The articulations formed between the skull, the atlas (C1 vertebra), and
the axis (C2 vertebra) differ from the articulations in other vertebral
areas and play important roles in movement of the head. The <span
data-type="term">atlanto-occipital joint</span> is formed by the
articulations between the superior articular processes of the atlas and
the occipital condyles on the base of the skull. This articulation has a
pronounced U-shaped curvature, oriented along the anterior-posterior
axis. This allows the skull to rock forward and backward, producing
flexion and extension of the head. This moves the head up and down, as
when shaking your head “yes.”
{: #fs-id2431430}

The <span data-type="term">atlantoaxial joint</span>, between the atlas
and axis, consists of three articulations. The paired superior articular
processes of the axis articulate with the inferior articular processes
of the atlas. These articulating surfaces are relatively flat and
oriented horizontally. The third articulation is the pivot joint formed
between the dens, which projects upward from the body of the axis, and
the inner aspect of the anterior arch of the atlas
([\[link\]](#fig-ch09_06_01){: .autogenerated-content}). A strong
ligament passes posterior to the dens to hold it in position against the
anterior arch. These articulations allow the atlas to rotate on top of
the axis, moving the head toward the right or left, as when shaking your
head “no.”

# Temporomandibular Joint
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">temporomandibular joint (TMJ)</span> is the
joint that allows for opening (mandibular depression) and closing
(mandibular elevation) of the mouth, as well as side-to-side and
protraction/retraction motions of the lower jaw. This joint involves the
articulation between the mandibular fossa and articular tubercle of the
temporal bone, with the condyle (head) of the mandible. Located between
these bony structures, filling the gap between the skull and mandible,
is a flexible articular disc ([\[link\]](#fig-ch09_06_02){:
.autogenerated-content}). This disc serves to smooth the movements
between the temporal bone and mandibular condyle.
{: #fs-id1380884}

Movement at the TMJ during opening and closing of the mouth involves
both gliding and hinge motions of the mandible. With the mouth closed,
the mandibular condyle and articular disc are located within the
mandibular fossa of the temporal bone. During opening of the mouth, the
mandible hinges downward and at the same time is pulled anteriorly,
causing both the condyle and the articular disc to glide forward from
the mandibular fossa onto the downward projecting articular tubercle.
The net result is a forward and downward motion of the condyle and
mandibular depression. The temporomandibular joint is supported by an
extrinsic ligament that anchors the mandible to the skull. This ligament
spans the distance between the base of the skull and the lingula on the
medial side of the mandibular ramus.
{: #fs-id2608267}

Dislocation of the TMJ may occur when opening the mouth too wide (such
as when taking a large bite) or following a blow to the jaw, resulting
in the mandibular condyle moving beyond (anterior to) the articular
tubercle. In this case, the individual would not be able to close his or
her mouth. Temporomandibular joint disorder is a painful condition that
may arise due to arthritis, wearing of the articular cartilage covering
the bony surfaces of the joint, muscle fatigue from overuse or grinding
of the teeth, damage to the articular disc within the joint, or jaw
injury. Temporomandibular joint disorders can also cause headache,
difficulty chewing, or even the inability to move the jaw (lock jaw).
Pharmacologic agents for pain or other therapies, including bite guards,
are used as treatments.

# Shoulder Joint
{: data-type="title"}

The shoulder joint is called the <span data-type="term">glenohumeral
joint</span>. This is a ball-and-socket joint formed by the articulation
between the head of the humerus and the glenoid cavity of the scapula
([\[link\]](#fig-ch09_06_03){: .autogenerated-content}). This joint has
the largest range of motion of any joint in the body. However, this
freedom of movement is due to the lack of structural support and thus
the enhanced mobility is offset by a loss of stability.
{: #fs-id2305343}

<figure id="fig-ch09_06_03">
<div data-type="title">
Glenohumeral Joint
</div>
<figcaption>
The glenohumeral (shoulder) joint is a ball-and-socket joint that
provides the widest range of motions. It has a loose articular capsule
and is supported by ligaments and the rotator cuff muscles.
</figcaption>
<span markdown="1" data-type="media" id="fs-id2450752" data-alt="This figure shows
the structure of the shoulder joint. The main ligaments and parts are

main ligaments and parts are
labeled.](../resources/914_Shoulder_Joint.jpg){:
data-media-type="image/jpg" width="430"} </span>
</figure>
The large range of motions at the shoulder joint is provided by the
articulation of the large, rounded humeral head with the small and
shallow glenoid cavity, which is only about one third of the size of the
humeral head. The socket formed by the glenoid cavity is deepened
slightly by a small lip of fibrocartilage called the <span
data-type="term">glenoid labrum</span>, which extends around the outer
margin of the cavity. The articular capsule that surrounds the
glenohumeral joint is relatively thin and loose to allow for large
motions of the upper limb. Some structural support for the joint is
provided by thickenings of the articular capsule wall that form weak
intrinsic ligaments. These include the <span
data-type="term">coracohumeral ligament</span>, running from the
coracoid process of the scapula to the anterior humerus, and three
ligaments, each called a <span data-type="term">glenohumeral
ligament</span>, located on the anterior side of the articular capsule.
These ligaments help to strengthen the superior and anterior capsule
walls.
{: #fs-id1231336}

However, the primary support for the shoulder joint is provided by
muscles crossing the joint, particularly the four rotator cuff muscles.
These muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and
subscapularis) arise from the scapula and attach to the greater or
lesser tubercles of the humerus. As these muscles cross the shoulder
joint, their tendons encircle the head of the humerus and become fused
to the anterior, superior, and posterior walls of the articular capsule.
The thickening of the capsule formed by the fusion of these four muscle
tendons is called the <span data-type="term">rotator cuff</span>. Two
bursae, the <span data-type="term">subacromial bursa</span> and the
<span data-type="term">subscapular bursa</span>, help to prevent
friction between the rotator cuff muscle tendons and the scapula as
these tendons cross the glenohumeral joint. In addition to their
individual actions of moving the upper limb, the rotator cuff muscles
also serve to hold the head of the humerus in position within the
glenoid cavity. By constantly adjusting their strength of contraction to
resist forces acting on the shoulder, these muscles serve as “dynamic
ligaments” and thus provide the primary structural support for the
glenohumeral joint.
{: #fs-id2429784}

Injuries to the shoulder joint are common. Repetitive use of the upper
limb, particularly in abduction such as during throwing, swimming, or
racquet sports, may lead to acute or chronic inflammation of the bursa
or muscle tendons, a tear of the glenoid labrum, or degeneration or
tears of the rotator cuff. Because the humeral head is strongly
supported by muscles and ligaments around its anterior, superior, and
posterior aspects, most dislocations of the humerus occur in an inferior
direction. This can occur when force is applied to the humerus when the
upper limb is fully abducted, as when diving to catch a baseball and
landing on your hand or elbow. Inflammatory responses to any shoulder
injury can lead to the formation of scar tissue between the articular
capsule and surrounding structures, thus reducing shoulder mobility, a
condition called adhesive capsulitis (“frozen shoulder”).

# Elbow Joint
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">elbow joint</span> is a uniaxial hinge joint
formed by the <span data-type="term">humeroulnar joint</span>, the
articulation between the trochlea of the humerus and the trochlear notch
of the ulna. Also associated with the elbow are the <span
data-type="term">humeroradial joint</span> and the proximal radioulnar
joint. All three of these joints are enclosed within a single articular
capsule ([\[link\]](#fig-ch09_06_04){: .autogenerated-content}).
{: #fs-id1355969}

The articular capsule of the elbow is thin on its anterior and posterior
aspects, but is thickened along its outside margins by strong intrinsic
ligaments. These ligaments prevent side-to-side movements and
hyperextension. On the medial side is the triangular <span
data-type="term">ulnar collateral ligament</span>. This arises from the
medial epicondyle of the humerus and attaches to the medial side of the
proximal ulna. The strongest part of this ligament is the anterior
portion, which resists hyperextension of the elbow. The ulnar collateral
ligament may be injured by frequent, forceful extensions of the forearm,
as is seen in baseball pitchers. Reconstructive surgical repair of this
ligament is referred to as Tommy John surgery, named for the former
major league pitcher who was the first person to have this treatment.
{: #fs-id2430675}

The lateral side of the elbow is supported by the <span
data-type="term">radial collateral ligament</span>. This arises from the
lateral epicondyle of the humerus and then blends into the lateral side
of the annular ligament. The <span data-type="term">annular
ligament</span> encircles the head of the radius. This ligament supports
the head of the radius as it articulates with the radial notch of the
ulna at the proximal radioulnar joint. This is a pivot joint that allows
for rotation of the radius during supination and pronation of the
forearm.

# Hip Joint
{: data-type="title"}

The hip joint is a multiaxial ball-and-socket joint between the head of
the femur and the acetabulum of the hip bone
([\[link\]](#fig-ch09_06_05){: .autogenerated-content}). The hip carries
the weight of the body and thus requires strength and stability during
standing and walking. For these reasons, its range of motion is more
limited than at the shoulder joint.
{: #fs-id2352177}

The acetabulum is the socket portion of the hip joint. This space is
deep and has a large articulation area for the femoral head, thus giving
stability and weight bearing ability to the joint. The acetabulum is
further deepened by the <span data-type="term">acetabular labrum</span>,
a fibrocartilage lip attached to the outer margin of the acetabulum. The
surrounding articular capsule is strong, with several thickened areas
forming intrinsic ligaments. These ligaments arise from the hip bone, at
the margins of the acetabulum, and attach to the femur at the base of
the neck. The ligaments are the <span data-type="term">iliofemoral
ligament</span>, <span data-type="term">pubofemoral ligament</span>, and
<span data-type="term">ischiofemoral ligament</span>, all of which
spiral around the head and neck of the femur. The ligaments are
tightened by extension at the hip, thus pulling the head of the femur
tightly into the acetabulum when in the upright, standing position. Very
little additional extension of the thigh is permitted beyond this
vertical position. These ligaments thus stabilize the hip joint and
allow you to maintain an upright standing position with only minimal
muscle contraction. Inside of the articular capsule, the <span
data-type="term">ligament of the head of the femur</span> (ligamentum
teres) spans between the acetabulum and femoral head. This intracapsular
ligament is normally slack and does not provide any significant joint
support, but it does provide a pathway for an important artery that
supplies the head of the femur.
{: #fs-id2621780}

The hip is prone to osteoarthritis, and thus was the first joint for
which a replacement prosthesis was developed. A common injury in elderly
individuals, particularly those with weakened bones due to osteoporosis,
is a “broken hip,” which is actually a fracture of the femoral neck.
This may result from a fall, or it may cause the fall. This can happen
as one lower limb is taking a step and all of the body weight is placed
on the other limb, causing the femoral neck to break and producing a
fall. Any accompanying disruption of the blood supply to the femoral
neck or head can lead to necrosis of these areas, resulting in bone and
cartilage death. Femoral fractures usually require surgical treatment,
after which the patient will need mobility assistance for a prolonged
period, either from family members or in a long-term care facility.
Consequentially, the associated health care costs of “broken hips” are
substantial. In addition, hip fractures are associated with increased
rates of morbidity (incidences of disease) and mortality (death).
Surgery for a hip fracture followed by prolonged bed rest may lead to
life-threatening complications, including pneumonia, infection of
pressure ulcers (bedsores), and thrombophlebitis (deep vein thrombosis;
blood clot formation) that can result in a pulmonary embolism (blood
clot within the lung).

# Knee Joint
{: data-type="title"}

The knee joint is the largest joint of the body
([\[link\]](#fig-ch09_06_06){: .autogenerated-content}). It actually
consists of three articulations. The <span
data-type="term">femoropatellar joint</span> is found between the
patella and the distal femur. The <span data-type="term">medial
tibiofemoral joint</span> and <span data-type="term">lateral
tibiofemoral joint</span> are located between the medial and lateral
condyles of the femur and the medial and lateral condyles of the tibia.
All of these articulations are enclosed within a single articular
capsule. The knee functions as a hinge joint, allowing flexion and
extension of the leg. This action is generated by both rolling and
gliding motions of the femur on the tibia. In addition, some rotation of
the leg is available when the knee is flexed, but not when extended. The
knee is well constructed for weight bearing in its extended position,
but is vulnerable to injuries associated with hyperextension, twisting,
or blows to the medial or lateral side of the joint, particularly while
weight bearing.
{: #fs-id2526857}

At the femoropatellar joint, the patella slides vertically within a
groove on the distal femur. The patella is a sesamoid bone incorporated
into the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle, the large muscle of
the anterior thigh. The patella serves to protect the quadriceps tendon
from friction against the distal femur. Continuing from the patella to
the anterior tibia just below the knee is the <span
data-type="term">patellar ligament</span>. Acting via the patella and
patellar ligament, the quadriceps femoris is a powerful muscle that acts
to extend the leg at the knee. It also serves as a “dynamic ligament” to
provide very important support and stabilization for the knee joint.
{: #fs-id2531615}

The medial and lateral tibiofemoral joints are the articulations between
the rounded condyles of the femur and the relatively flat condyles of
the tibia. During flexion and extension motions, the condyles of the
femur both roll and glide over the surfaces of the tibia. The rolling
action produces flexion or extension, while the gliding action serves to
maintain the femoral condyles centered over the tibial condyles, thus
ensuring maximal bony, weight-bearing support for the femur in all knee
positions. As the knee comes into full extension, the femur undergoes a
slight medial rotation in relation to tibia. The rotation results
because the lateral condyle of the femur is slightly smaller than the
medial condyle. Thus, the lateral condyle finishes its rolling motion
first, followed by the medial condyle. The resulting small medial
rotation of the femur serves to “lock” the knee into its fully extended
and most stable position. Flexion of the knee is initiated by a slight
lateral rotation of the femur on the tibia, which “unlocks” the knee.
This lateral rotation motion is produced by the popliteus muscle of the
posterior leg.
{: #fs-id2227441}

Located between the articulating surfaces of the femur and tibia are two
articular discs, the <span data-type="term">medial meniscus</span> and
<span data-type="term">lateral meniscus</span> (see
[\[link\]](#fig-ch09_06_06){: .autogenerated-content}**b**{:
data-effect="bold"}). Each is a C-shaped fibrocartilage structure that
is thin along its inside margin and thick along the outer margin. They
are attached to their tibial condyles, but do not attach to the femur.
While both menisci are free to move during knee motions, the medial
meniscus shows less movement because it is anchored at its outer margin
to the articular capsule and tibial collateral ligament. The menisci
provide padding between the bones and help to fill the gap between the
round femoral condyles and flattened tibial condyles. Some areas of each
meniscus lack an arterial blood supply and thus these areas heal poorly
if damaged.
{: #fs-id2200858}

The knee joint has multiple ligaments that provide support, particularly
in the extended position (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch09_06_06){:
.autogenerated-content}**c**{: data-effect="bold"}). Outside of the
articular capsule, located at the sides of the knee, are two extrinsic
ligaments. The <span data-type="term">fibular collateral ligament</span>
(lateral collateral ligament) is on the lateral side and spans from the
lateral epicondyle of the femur to the head of the fibula. The <span
data-type="term">tibial collateral ligament</span> (medial collateral
ligament) of the medial knee runs from the medial epicondyle of the
femur to the medial tibia. As it crosses the knee, the tibial collateral
ligament is firmly attached on its deep side to the articular capsule
and to the medial meniscus, an important factor when considering knee
injuries. In the fully extended knee position, both collateral ligaments
are taut (tight), thus serving to stabilize and support the extended
knee and preventing side-to-side or rotational motions between the femur
and tibia.
{: #fs-id1353360}

The articular capsule of the posterior knee is thickened by intrinsic
ligaments that help to resist knee hyperextension. Inside the knee are
two intracapsular ligaments, the <span data-type="term">anterior
cruciate ligament</span> and <span data-type="term">posterior cruciate
ligament</span>. These ligaments are anchored inferiorly to the tibia at
the intercondylar eminence, the roughened area between the tibial
condyles. The cruciate ligaments are named for whether they are attached
anteriorly or posteriorly to this tibial region. Each ligament runs
diagonally upward to attach to the inner aspect of a femoral condyle.
The cruciate ligaments are named for the X-shape formed as they pass
each other (cruciate means “cross”). The posterior cruciate ligament is
the stronger ligament. It serves to support the knee when it is flexed
and weight bearing, as when walking downhill. In this position, the
posterior cruciate ligament prevents the femur from sliding anteriorly
off the top of the tibia. The anterior cruciate ligament becomes tight
when the knee is extended, and thus resists hyperextension.

</div>
<span data-type="title">Joints</span> Injuries to the knee are common.
Since this joint is primarily supported by muscles and ligaments,
injuries to any of these structures will result in pain or knee
instability. Injury to the posterior cruciate ligament occurs when the
knee is flexed and the tibia is driven posteriorly, such as falling and
landing on the tibial tuberosity or hitting the tibia on the dashboard
when not wearing a seatbelt during an automobile accident. More
commonly, injuries occur when forces are applied to the extended knee,
particularly when the foot is planted and unable to move. Anterior
cruciate ligament injuries can result with a forceful blow to the
anterior knee, producing hyperextension, or when a runner makes a quick
change of direction that produces both twisting and hyperextension of
the knee.
{: #fs-id2574621}

A worse combination of injuries can occur with a hit to the lateral side
of the extended knee ([\[link\]](#fig-ch09_06_07){:
.autogenerated-content}). A moderate blow to the lateral knee will cause
the medial side of the joint to open, resulting in stretching or damage
to the tibial collateral ligament. Because the medial meniscus is
attached to the tibial collateral ligament, a stronger blow can tear the
ligament and also damage the medial meniscus. This is one reason that
the medial meniscus is 20 times more likely to be injured than the
lateral meniscus. A powerful blow to the lateral knee produces a
“terrible triad” injury, in which there is a sequential injury to the
tibial collateral ligament, medial meniscus, and anterior cruciate
ligament.
{: #fs-id2338900}

Arthroscopic surgery has greatly improved the surgical treatment of knee
injuries and reduced subsequent recovery times. This procedure involves
a small incision and the insertion into the joint of an arthroscope, a
pencil-thin instrument that allows for visualization of the joint
interior. Small surgical instruments are also inserted via additional
incisions. These tools allow a surgeon to remove or repair a torn
meniscus or to reconstruct a ruptured cruciate ligament. The current
method for anterior cruciate ligament replacement involves using a
portion of the patellar ligament. Holes are drilled into the cruciate
ligament attachment points on the tibia and femur, and the patellar
ligament graft, with small areas of attached bone still intact at each
end, is inserted into these holes. The bone-to-bone sites at each end of
the graft heal rapidly and strongly, thus enabling a rapid recovery.

# Ankle and Foot Joints
{: data-type="title"}

The ankle is formed by the <span data-type="term">talocrural
joint</span> ([\[link\]](#fig-ch09_06_08){: .autogenerated-content}). It
consists of the articulations between the talus bone of the foot and the
distal ends of the tibia and fibula of the leg (crural = “leg”). The
superior aspect of the talus bone is square-shaped and has three areas
of articulation. The top of the talus articulates with the inferior
tibia. This is the portion of the ankle joint that carries the body
weight between the leg and foot. The sides of the talus are firmly held
in position by the articulations with the medial malleolus of the tibia
and the lateral malleolus of the fibula, which prevent any side-to-side
motion of the talus. The ankle is thus a uniaxial hinge joint that
allows only for dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the foot.
{: #fs-id1838236}

Additional joints between the tarsal bones of the posterior foot allow
for the movements of foot inversion and eversion. Most important for
these movements is the <span data-type="term">subtalar joint</span>,
located between the talus and calcaneus bones. The joints between the
talus and navicular bones and the calcaneus and cuboid bones are also
important contributors to these movements. All of the joints between
tarsal bones are plane joints. Together, the small motions that take
place at these joints all contribute to the production of inversion and
eversion foot motions.
{: #fs-id1482831}

Like the hinge joints of the elbow and knee, the talocrural joint of the
ankle is supported by several strong ligaments located on the sides of
the joint. These ligaments extend from the medial malleolus of the tibia
or lateral malleolus of the fibula and anchor to the talus and calcaneus
bones. Since they are located on the sides of the ankle joint, they
allow for dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the foot. They also
prevent abnormal side-to-side and twisting movements of the talus and
calcaneus bones during eversion and inversion of the foot. On the medial
side is the broad <span data-type="term">deltoid ligament</span>. The
deltoid ligament supports the ankle joint and also resists excessive
eversion of the foot. The lateral side of the ankle has several smaller
ligaments. These include the <span data-type="term">anterior talofibular
ligament</span> and the <span data-type="term">posterior talofibular
ligament</span>, both of which span between the talus bone and the
lateral malleolus of the fibula, and the <span
data-type="term">calcaneofibular ligament</span>, located between the
calcaneus bone and fibula. These ligaments support the ankle and also
resist excess inversion of the foot.

The talocrural (ankle) joint is a uniaxial hinge joint that only allows
for dorsiflexion or plantar flexion of the foot. Movements at the
subtalar joint, between the talus and calcaneus bones, combined with
motions at other intertarsal joints, enables eversion/inversion

Disorders of the…
</div>
<span data-type="title">Joints</span> The ankle is the most frequently
injured joint in the body, with the most common injury being an
inversion ankle sprain. A sprain is the stretching or tearing of the
supporting ligaments. Excess inversion causes the talus bone to tilt
laterally, thus damaging the ligaments on the lateral side of the ankle.
The anterior talofibular ligament is most commonly injured, followed by
the calcaneofibular ligament. In severe inversion injuries, the forceful
lateral movement of the talus not only ruptures the lateral ankle
ligaments, but also fractures the distal fibula.
{: #fs-id1373188}

Less common are eversion sprains of the ankle, which involve stretching
of the deltoid ligament on the medial side of the ankle. Forcible
eversion of the foot, for example, with an awkward landing from a jump
or when a football player has a foot planted and is hit on the lateral
ankle, can result in a Pott’s fracture and dislocation of the ankle
joint. In this injury, the very strong deltoid ligament does not tear,
but instead shears off the medial malleolus of the tibia. This frees the
talus, which moves laterally and fractures the distal fibula. In extreme
cases, the posterior margin of the tibia may also be sheared off.
{: #fs-id1380705}

Above the ankle, the distal ends of the tibia and fibula are united by a
strong syndesmosis formed by the interosseous membrane and ligaments at
the distal tibiofibular joint. These connections prevent separation
between the distal ends of the tibia and fibula and maintain the talus
locked into position between the medial malleolus and lateral malleolus.
Injuries that produce a lateral twisting of the leg on top of the
planted foot can result in stretching or tearing of the tibiofibular
ligaments, producing a syndesmotic ankle sprain or “high ankle sprain.”
{: #fs-id2661098}

Most ankle sprains can be treated using the RICE technique: Rest, Ice,
Compression, and Elevation. Reducing joint mobility using a brace or
cast may be required for a period of time. More severe injuries
involving ligament tears or bone fractures may require surgery.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

Although synovial joints share many common features, each joint of the
body is specialized for certain movements and activities. The joints of
the upper limb provide for large ranges of motion, which give the upper
limb great mobility, thus enabling actions such as the throwing of a
ball or typing on a keyboard. The joints of the lower limb are more
robust, giving them greater strength and the stability needed to support
the body weight during running, jumping, or kicking activities.
{: #fs-id1894739}

The joints of the vertebral column include the symphysis joints formed
by each intervertebral disc and the plane synovial joints between the
superior and inferior articular processes of adjacent vertebrae. Each of
these joints provide for limited motions, but these sum together to
produce flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and rotation of the neck
and body. The range of motions available in each region of the vertebral
column varies, with all of these motions available in the cervical
region. Only rotation is allowed in the thoracic region, while the
lumbar region has considerable extension, flexion, and lateral flexion,
but rotation is prevented. The atlanto-occipital joint allows for
flexion and extension of the head, while the atlantoaxial joint is a
pivot joint that provides for rotation of the head.
{: #fs-id2096998}

The temporomandibular joint is the articulation between the condyle of
the mandible and the mandibular fossa and articular tubercle of the
skull temporal bone. An articular disc is located between the bony
components of this joint. A combination of gliding and hinge motions of
the mandibular condyle allows for elevation/depression,
protraction/retraction, and side-to-side motions of the lower jaw.
{: #fs-id1335682}

The glenohumeral (shoulder) joint is a multiaxial ball-and-socket joint
that provides flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, circumduction, and
medial/lateral rotation of the humerus. The head of the humerus
articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula. The glenoid labrum
extends around the margin of the glenoid cavity. Intrinsic ligaments,
including the coracohumeral ligament and glenohumeral ligaments, provide
some support for the shoulder joint. However, the primary support comes
from muscles crossing the joint whose tendons form the rotator cuff.
These muscle tendons are protected from friction against the scapula by
the subacromial bursa and subscapular bursa.
{: #fs-id2176349}

The elbow is a uniaxial hinge joint that allows for flexion/extension of
the forearm. It includes the humeroulnar joint and the humeroradial
joint. The medial elbow is supported by the ulnar collateral ligament
and the radial collateral ligament supports the lateral side. These
ligaments prevent side-to-side movements and resist hyperextension of
the elbow. The proximal radioulnar joint is a pivot joint that allows
for rotation of the radius during pronation/supination of the forearm.
The annular ligament surrounds the head of the radius to hold it in
place at this joint.
{: #fs-id2633538}

The hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint whose motions are more
restricted than at the shoulder to provide greater stability during
weight bearing. The hip joint is the articulation between the head of
the femur and the acetabulum of the hip bone. The acetabulum is deepened
by the acetabular labrum. The iliofemoral, pubofemoral, and
ischiofemoral ligaments strongly support the hip joint in the upright,
standing position. The ligament of the head of the femur provides little
support but carries an important artery that supplies the femur.
{: #fs-id2299103}

The knee includes three articulations. The femoropatellar joint is
between the patella and distal femur. The patella, a sesamoid bone
incorporated into the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle of the
anterior thigh, serves to protect this tendon from rubbing against the
distal femur during knee movements. The medial and lateral tibiofemoral
joints, between the condyles of the femur and condyles of the tibia, are
modified hinge joints that allow for knee extension and flexion. During
these movements, the condyles of the femur both roll and glide over the
surface of the tibia. As the knee comes into full extension, a slight
medial rotation of the femur serves to “lock” the knee into its most
stable, weight-bearing position. The reverse motion, a small lateral
rotation of the femur, is required to initiate knee flexion. When the
knee is flexed, some rotation of the leg is available.
{: #fs-id1433963}

Two extrinsic ligaments, the tibial collateral ligament on the medial
side and the fibular collateral ligament on the lateral side, serve to
resist hyperextension or rotation of the extended knee joint. Two
intracapsular ligaments, the anterior cruciate ligament and posterior
cruciate ligament, span between the tibia and the inner aspects of the
femoral condyles. The anterior cruciate ligament resists hyperextension
of the knee, while the posterior cruciate ligament prevents anterior
sliding of the femur, thus supporting the knee when it is flexed and
weight bearing. The medial and lateral menisci, located between the
femoral and tibial condyles, are articular discs that provide padding
and improve the fit between the bones.
{: #fs-id2002498}

The talocrural joint forms the ankle. It consists of the articulation
between the talus bone and the medial malleolus of the tibia, the distal
end of the tibia, and the lateral malleolus of the fibula. This is a
uniaxial hinge joint that allows only dorsiflexion and plantar flexion
of the foot. Gliding motions at the subtalar and intertarsal joints of
the foot allow for inversion/eversion of the foot. The ankle joint is
supported on the medial side by the deltoid ligament, which prevents
side-to-side motions of the talus at the talocrural joint and resists
excessive eversion of the foot. The lateral ankle is supported by the
anterior and posterior talofibular ligaments and the calcaneofibular
ligament. These support the ankle joint and also resist excess inversion
of the foot. An inversion ankle sprain, a common injury, will result in
injury to one or more of these lateral ankle ligaments.

ankle sprains, and treatment. During an inversion ankle sprain injury,
all three ligaments that resist excessive inversion of the foot may be
injured. What is the sequence in which these three ligaments are
injured?

An inversion ankle sprain may injure all three ligaments located on the
lateral side of the ankle. The sequence of injury would be the anterior
talofibular ligament first, followed by the calcaneofibular ligament
second, and finally, the posterior talofibular ligament third.

Discuss the structures that contribute to support of the shoulder joint.
{: #fs-id1513486}

</div>
<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id2347344" data-label="" markdown="1">
The shoulder joint allows for a large range of motion. The primary
support for the shoulder joint is provided by the four rotator cuff
muscles. These muscles serve as “dynamic ligaments” and thus can
modulate their strengths of contraction as needed to hold the head of
the humerus in position at the glenoid fossa. Additional but weaker
support comes from the coracohumeral ligament, an intrinsic ligament
that supports the superior aspect of the shoulder joint, and the
glenohumeral ligaments, which are intrinsic ligaments that support the
anterior side of the joint.

Describe the sequence of injuries that may occur if the extended,
weight-bearing knee receives a very strong blow to the lateral side of
the knee.
{: #fs-id1702222}

</div>
<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id1702226" data-label="" markdown="1">
A strong blow to the lateral side of the extended knee will cause the
medial side of the knee joint to open, resulting in a sequence of three
injuries. First will be damage to the tibial collateral ligament. Since
the medial meniscus is attached to the tibial collateral ligament, the
meniscus is also injured. The third structure injured would be the
anterior cruciate ligament.
