The vertebral column is also known as the spinal column or spine
([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_03_01){: .autogenerated-content}). It consists of
a sequence of vertebrae (singular = vertebra), each of which is
separated and united by an <span data-type="term">intervertebral
disc</span>. Together, the vertebrae and intervertebral discs form the
vertebral column. It is a flexible column that supports the head, neck,
and body and allows for their movements. It also protects the spinal
cord, which passes down the back through openings in the vertebrae.

The adult vertebral column consists of 24 vertebrae, plus the sacrum and
coccyx. The vertebrae are divided into three regions: cervical C1–C7
vertebrae, thoracic T1–T12 vertebrae, and lumbar L1–L5 vertebrae. The
vertebral column is curved, with two primary curvatures (thoracic and
sacrococcygeal curves) and two secondary curvatures (cervical and lumbar
curves).

# Regions of the Vertebral Column
{: data-type="title"}

The vertebral column originally develops as a series of 33 vertebrae,
but this number is eventually reduced to 24 vertebrae, plus the sacrum
and coccyx. The vertebral column is subdivided into five regions, with
the vertebrae in each area named for that region and numbered in
descending order. In the neck, there are seven cervical vertebrae, each
designated with the letter “C” followed by its number. Superiorly, the
C1 vertebra articulates (forms a joint) with the occipital condyles of
the skull. Inferiorly, C1 articulates with the C2 vertebra, and so on.
Below these are the 12 thoracic vertebrae, designated T1–T12. The lower
back contains the L1–L5 lumbar vertebrae. The single sacrum, which is
also part of the pelvis, is formed by the fusion of five sacral
vertebrae. Similarly, the coccyx, or tailbone, results from the fusion
of four small coccygeal vertebrae. However, the sacral and coccygeal
fusions do not start until age 20 and are not completed until middle
age.
{: #fs-id2176036}

An interesting anatomical fact is that almost all mammals have seven
cervical vertebrae, regardless of body size. This means that there are
large variations in the size of cervical vertebrae, ranging from the
very small cervical vertebrae of a shrew to the greatly elongated
vertebrae in the neck of a giraffe. In a full-grown giraffe, each
cervical vertebra is 11 inches tall.

# Curvatures of the Vertebral Column
{: data-type="title"}

The adult vertebral column does not form a straight line, but instead
has four curvatures along its length (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch07_03_01){:
.autogenerated-content}). These curves increase the vertebral column’s
strength, flexibility, and ability to absorb shock. When the load on the
spine is increased, by carrying a heavy backpack for example, the
curvatures increase in depth (become more curved) to accommodate the
extra weight. They then spring back when the weight is removed. The four
adult curvatures are classified as either primary or secondary
curvatures. Primary curves are retained from the original fetal
curvature, while secondary curvatures develop after birth.
{: #fs-id2148374}

During fetal development, the body is flexed anteriorly into the fetal
position, giving the entire vertebral column a single curvature that is
concave anteriorly. In the adult, this fetal curvature is retained in
two regions of the vertebral column as the <span
data-type="term">thoracic curve</span>, which involves the thoracic
vertebrae, and the <span data-type="term">sacrococcygeal curve</span>,
formed by the sacrum and coccyx. Each of these is thus called a <span
data-type="term">primary curve</span> because they are retained from the
original fetal curvature of the vertebral column.
{: #fs-id2340336}

A <span data-type="term">secondary curve</span> develops gradually after
birth as the child learns to sit upright, stand, and walk. Secondary
curves are concave posteriorly, opposite in direction to the original
fetal curvature. The <span data-type="term">cervical curve</span> of the
neck region develops as the infant begins to hold their head upright
when sitting. Later, as the child begins to stand and then to walk, the
<span data-type="term">lumbar curve</span> of the lower back develops.
In adults, the lumbar curve is generally deeper in females.
{: #fs-id806646}

Disorders associated with the curvature of the spine include <span
data-type="term">kyphosis</span> (an excessive posterior curvature of
the thoracic region), <span data-type="term">lordosis</span> (an
excessive anterior curvature of the lumbar region), and <span
data-type="term">scoliosis</span> (an abnormal, lateral curvature,
accompanied by twisting of the vertebral column).

Disorders of the...
</div>
<span data-type="title">Vertebral Column</span> Developmental anomalies,
pathological changes, or obesity can enhance the normal vertebral column
curves, resulting in the development of abnormal or excessive curvatures
([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_03_02){: .autogenerated-content}). Kyphosis, also
referred to as humpback or hunchback, is an excessive posterior
curvature of the thoracic region. This can develop when osteoporosis
causes weakening and erosion of the anterior portions of the upper
thoracic vertebrae, resulting in their gradual collapse
([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_03_03){: .autogenerated-content}). Lordosis, or
swayback, is an excessive anterior curvature of the lumbar region and is
most commonly associated with obesity or late pregnancy. The
accumulation of body weight in the abdominal region results an anterior
shift in the line of gravity that carries the weight of the body. This
causes in an anterior tilt of the pelvis and a pronounced enhancement of
the lumbar curve.
{: #fs-id2251576}

Scoliosis is an abnormal, lateral curvature, accompanied by twisting of
the vertebral column. Compensatory curves may also develop in other
areas of the vertebral column to help maintain the head positioned over
the feet. Scoliosis is the most common vertebral abnormality among
girls. The cause is usually unknown, but it may result from weakness of
the back muscles, defects such as differential growth rates in the right
and left sides of the vertebral column, or differences in the length of
the lower limbs. When present, scoliosis tends to get worse during
adolescent growth spurts. Although most individuals do not require
treatment, a back brace may be recommended for growing children. In
extreme cases, surgery may be required.
{: #fs-id2252996}

Excessive vertebral curves can be identified while an individual stands
in the anatomical position. Observe the vertebral profile from the side
and then from behind to check for kyphosis or lordosis. Then have the
person bend forward. If scoliosis is present, an individual will have
difficulty in bending directly forward, and the right and left sides of
the back will not be level with each other in the bent position.

# General Structure of a Vertebra
{: data-type="title"}

Within the different regions of the vertebral column, vertebrae vary in
size and shape, but they all follow a similar structural pattern. A
typical vertebra will consist of a body, a vertebral arch, and seven
processes ([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_03_04){: .autogenerated-content}).
{: #fs-id2349897}

The body is the anterior portion of each vertebra and is the part that
supports the body weight. Because of this, the vertebral bodies
progressively increase in size and thickness going down the vertebral
column. The bodies of adjacent vertebrae are separated and strongly
united by an intervertebral disc.
{: #fs-id1549444}

The <span data-type="term">vertebral arch</span> forms the posterior
portion of each vertebra. It consists of four parts, the right and left
pedicles and the right and left laminae. Each <span
data-type="term">pedicle</span> forms one of the lateral sides of the
vertebral arch. The pedicles are anchored to the posterior side of the
vertebral body. Each <span data-type="term">lamina</span> forms part of
the posterior roof of the vertebral arch. The large opening between the
vertebral arch and body is the <span data-type="term">vertebral
foramen</span>, which contains the spinal cord. In the intact vertebral
column, the vertebral foramina of all of the vertebrae align to form the
<span data-type="term">vertebral (spinal) canal</span>, which serves as
the bony protection and passageway for the spinal cord down the back.
When the vertebrae are aligned together in the vertebral column, notches
in the margins of the pedicles of adjacent vertebrae together form an
<span data-type="term">intervertebral foramen</span>, the opening
through which a spinal nerve exits from the vertebral column
([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_03_05){: .autogenerated-content}).
{: #fs-id1752241}

Seven processes arise from the vertebral arch. Each paired <span
data-type="term">transverse process</span> projects laterally and arises
from the junction point between the pedicle and lamina. The single <span
data-type="term">spinous process</span> (vertebral spine) projects
posteriorly at the midline of the back. The vertebral spines can easily
be felt as a series of bumps just under the skin down the middle of the
back. The transverse and spinous processes serve as important muscle
attachment sites. A <span data-type="term">superior articular
process</span> extends or faces upward, and an <span
data-type="term">inferior articular process</span> faces or projects
downward on each side of a vertebrae. The paired superior articular
processes of one vertebra join with the corresponding paired inferior
articular processes from the next higher vertebra. These junctions form
slightly moveable joints between the adjacent vertebrae. The shape and
orientation of the articular processes vary in different regions of the
vertebral column and play a major role in determining the type and range
of motion available in each region.

# Regional Modifications of Vertebrae
{: data-type="title"}

In addition to the general characteristics of a typical vertebra
described above, vertebrae also display characteristic size and
structural features that vary between the different vertebral column
regions. Thus, cervical vertebrae are smaller than lumbar vertebrae due
to differences in the proportion of body weight that each supports.
Thoracic vertebrae have sites for rib attachment, and the vertebrae that
give rise to the sacrum and coccyx have fused together into single
bones.
{: #fs-id1841429}

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2350051" markdown="1">
## Cervical Vertebrae
{: data-type="title"}

Typical <span data-type="term">cervical vertebrae</span>, such as C4 or
C5, have several characteristic features that differentiate them from
thoracic or lumbar vertebrae ([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_03_06){:
.autogenerated-content}). Cervical vertebrae have a small body,
reflecting the fact that they carry the least amount of body weight.
Cervical vertebrae usually have a bifid (Y-shaped) spinous process. The
spinous processes of the C3–C6 vertebrae are short, but the spine of C7
is much longer. You can find these vertebrae by running your finger down
the midline of the posterior neck until you encounter the prominent C7
spine located at the base of the neck. The transverse processes of the
cervical vertebrae are sharply curved (U-shaped) to allow for passage of
the cervical spinal nerves. Each transverse process also has an opening
called the <span data-type="term">transverse foramen</span>. An
important artery that supplies the brain ascends up the neck by passing
through these openings. The superior and inferior articular processes of
the cervical vertebrae are flattened and largely face upward or
downward, respectively.
{: #fs-id2157005}

The first and second cervical vertebrae are further modified, giving
each a distinctive appearance. The first cervical (C1) vertebra is also
called the <span data-type="term">atlas</span>, because this is the
vertebra that supports the skull on top of the vertebral column (in
Greek mythology, Atlas was the god who supported the heavens on his
shoulders). The C1 vertebra does not have a body or spinous process.
Instead, it is ring-shaped, consisting of an <span
data-type="term">anterior arch</span> and a <span
data-type="term">posterior arch</span>. The transverse processes of the
atlas are longer and extend more laterally than do the transverse
processes of any other cervical vertebrae. The superior articular
processes face upward and are deeply curved for articulation with the
occipital condyles on the base of the skull. The inferior articular
processes are flat and face downward to join with the superior articular
processes of the C2 vertebra.
{: #fs-id2228247}

The second cervical (C2) vertebra is called the <span
data-type="term">axis</span>, because it serves as the axis for rotation
when turning the head toward the right or left. The axis resembles
typical cervical vertebrae in most respects, but is easily distinguished
by the <span data-type="term">dens</span> (odontoid process), a bony
projection that extends upward from the vertebral body. The dens joins
with the inner aspect of the anterior arch of the atlas, where it is
held in place by transverse ligament.

The bodies of the <span data-type="term">thoracic vertebrae</span> are
larger than those of cervical vertebrae ([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_03_07){:
.autogenerated-content}). The characteristic feature for a typical
midthoracic vertebra is the spinous process, which is long and has a
pronounced downward angle that causes it to overlap the next inferior
vertebra. The superior articular processes of thoracic vertebrae face
anteriorly and the inferior processes face posteriorly. These
orientations are important determinants for the type and range of
movements available to the thoracic region of the vertebral column.
{: #fs-id2266978}

Thoracic vertebrae have several additional articulation sites, each of
which is called a <span data-type="term">facet</span>, where a rib is
attached. Most thoracic vertebrae have two facets located on the lateral
sides of the body, each of which is called a <span
data-type="term">costal facet</span> (costal = “rib”). These are for
articulation with the head (end) of a rib. An additional facet is
located on the transverse process for articulation with the tubercle of
a rib.

## Sacrum and Coccyx
{: data-type="title"}

The sacrum is a triangular-shaped bone that is thick and wide across its
superior base where it is weight bearing and then tapers down to an
inferior, non-weight bearing apex ([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_03_10){:
.autogenerated-content}). It is formed by the fusion of five sacral
vertebrae, a process that does not begin until after the age of 20. On
the anterior surface of the older adult sacrum, the lines of vertebral
fusion can be seen as four transverse ridges. On the posterior surface,
running down the midline, is the <span data-type="term">median sacral
crest</span>, a bumpy ridge that is the remnant of the fused spinous
processes (median = “midline”; while medial = “toward, but not
necessarily at, the midline”). Similarly, the fused transverse processes
of the sacral vertebrae form the <span data-type="term">lateral sacral
crest</span>.
{: #fs-id1861665}

The <span data-type="term">sacral promontory</span> is the anterior lip
of the superior base of the sacrum. Lateral to this is the roughened
auricular surface, which joins with the ilium portion of the hipbone to
form the immobile sacroiliac joints of the pelvis. Passing inferiorly
through the sacrum is a bony tunnel called the <span
data-type="term">sacral canal</span>, which terminates at the <span
data-type="term">sacral hiatus</span> near the inferior tip of the
sacrum. The anterior and posterior surfaces of the sacrum have a series
of paired openings called <span data-type="term">sacral foramina</span>
(singular = foramen) that connect to the sacral canal. Each of these
openings is called a <span data-type="term">posterior (dorsal) sacral
foramen</span> or <span data-type="term">anterior (ventral) sacral
foramen</span>. These openings allow for the anterior and posterior
branches of the sacral spinal nerves to exit the sacrum. The <span
data-type="term">superior articular process of the sacrum</span>, one of
which is found on either side of the superior opening of the sacral
canal, articulates with the inferior articular processes from the L5
vertebra.

The coccyx, or tailbone, is derived from the fusion of four very small
coccygeal vertebrae (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch07_03_10){:

# Intervertebral Discs and Ligaments of the Vertebral Column
{: data-type="title"}

The bodies of adjacent vertebrae are strongly anchored to each other by
an intervertebral disc. This structure provides padding between the
bones during weight bearing, and because it can change shape, also
allows for movement between the vertebrae. Although the total amount of
movement available between any two adjacent vertebrae is small, when
these movements are summed together along the entire length of the
vertebral column, large body movements can be produced. Ligaments that
extend along the length of the vertebral column also contribute to its
overall support and stability.

## Intervertebral Disc
{: data-type="title"}

An <span data-type="term">intervertebral disc</span> is a
fibrocartilaginous pad that fills the gap between adjacent vertebral
bodies (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch07_03_05){: .autogenerated-content}). Each
disc is anchored to the bodies of its adjacent vertebrae, thus strongly
uniting these. The discs also provide padding between vertebrae during
weight bearing. Because of this, intervertebral discs are thin in the
cervical region and thickest in the lumbar region, which carries the
most body weight. In total, the intervertebral discs account for
approximately 25 percent of your body height between the top of the
pelvis and the base of the skull. Intervertebral discs are also flexible
and can change shape to allow for movements of the vertebral column.
{: #fs-id1388902}

Each intervertebral disc consists of two parts. The <span
data-type="term">anulus fibrosus</span> is the tough, fibrous outer
layer of the disc. It forms a circle (anulus = “ring” or “circle”) and
is firmly anchored to the outer margins of the adjacent vertebral
bodies. Inside is the <span data-type="term">nucleus pulposus</span>,
consisting of a softer, more gel-like material. It has a high water
content that serves to resist compression and thus is important for
weight bearing. With increasing age, the water content of the nucleus
pulposus gradually declines. This causes the disc to become thinner,
decreasing total body height somewhat, and reduces the flexibility and
range of motion of the disc, making bending more difficult.
{: #fs-id1339348}

The gel-like nature of the nucleus pulposus also allows the
intervertebral disc to change shape as one vertebra rocks side to side
or forward and back in relation to its neighbors during movements of the
vertebral column. Thus, bending forward causes compression of the
anterior portion of the disc but expansion of the posterior disc. If the
posterior anulus fibrosus is weakened due to injury or increasing age,
the pressure exerted on the disc when bending forward and lifting a
heavy object can cause the nucleus pulposus to protrude posteriorly
through the anulus fibrosus, resulting in a herniated disc (“ruptured”
or “slipped” disc) ([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_03_11){:
.autogenerated-content}). The posterior bulging of the nucleus pulposus
can cause compression of a spinal nerve at the point where it exits
through the intervertebral foramen, with resulting pain and/or muscle
weakness in those body regions supplied by that nerve. The most common
sites for disc herniation are the L4/L5 or L5/S1 intervertebral discs,
which can cause sciatica, a widespread pain that radiates from the lower
back down the thigh and into the leg. Similar injuries of the C5/C6 or
C6/C7 intervertebral discs, following forcible hyperflexion of the neck
from a collision accident or football injury, can produce pain in the
neck, shoulder, and upper limb.

## Ligaments of the Vertebral Column
{: data-type="title"}

Adjacent vertebrae are united by ligaments that run the length of the
vertebral column along both its posterior and anterior aspects
([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_03_12){: .autogenerated-content}). These serve to
resist excess forward or backward bending movements of the vertebral
column, respectively.
{: #fs-id2298074}

The <span data-type="term">anterior longitudinal ligament</span> runs
down the anterior side of the entire vertebral column, uniting the
vertebral bodies. It serves to resist excess backward bending of the
vertebral column. Protection against this movement is particularly
important in the neck, where extreme posterior bending of the head and
neck can stretch or tear this ligament, resulting in a painful whiplash
injury. Prior to the mandatory installation of seat headrests, whiplash
injuries were common for passengers involved in a rear-end automobile
collision.
{: #fs-id1367709}

The <span data-type="term">supraspinous ligament</span> is located on
the posterior side of the vertebral column, where it interconnects the
spinous processes of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. This strong
ligament supports the vertebral column during forward bending motions.
In the posterior neck, where the cervical spinous processes are short,
the supraspinous ligament expands to become the <span
data-type="term">nuchal ligament</span> (nuchae = “nape” or “back of the
neck”). The nuchal ligament is attached to the cervical spinous
processes and extends upward and posteriorly to attach to the midline
base of the skull, out to the external occipital protuberance. It
supports the skull and prevents it from falling forward. This ligament
is much larger and stronger in four-legged animals such as cows, where
the large skull hangs off the front end of the vertebral column. You can
easily feel this ligament by first extending your head backward and
pressing down on the posterior midline of your neck. Then tilt your head
forward and you will fill the nuchal ligament popping out as it tightens
to limit anterior bending of the head and neck.
{: #fs-id1854748}

Additional ligaments are located inside the vertebral canal, next to the
spinal cord, along the length of the vertebral column. The <span
data-type="term">posterior longitudinal ligament</span> is found
anterior to the spinal cord, where it is attached to the posterior sides
of the vertebral bodies. Posterior to the spinal cord is the <span
data-type="term">ligamentum flavum</span> (“yellow ligament”). This
consists of a series of short, paired ligaments, each of which
interconnects the lamina regions of adjacent vertebrae. The ligamentum
flavum has large numbers of elastic fibers, which have a yellowish
color, allowing it to stretch and then pull back. Both of these
ligaments provide important support for the vertebral column when
bending forward.

<span data-type="title">Chiropractor</span> Chiropractors are health
professionals who use nonsurgical techniques to help patients with
musculoskeletal system problems that involve the bones, muscles,
ligaments, tendons, or nervous system. They treat problems such as neck
pain, back pain, joint pain, or headaches. Chiropractors focus on the
patient’s overall health and can also provide counseling related to
lifestyle issues, such as diet, exercise, or sleep problems. If needed,
they will refer the patient to other medical specialists.
{: #fs-id2402686}

Chiropractors use a drug-free, hands-on approach for patient diagnosis
and treatment. They will perform a physical exam, assess the patient’s
posture and spine, and may perform additional diagnostic tests,
including taking X-ray images. They primarily use manual techniques,
such as spinal manipulation, to adjust the patient’s spine or other
joints. They can recommend therapeutic or rehabilitative exercises, and
some also include acupuncture, massage therapy, or ultrasound as part of
the treatment program. In addition to those in general practice, some
chiropractors specialize in sport injuries, neurology, orthopaedics,
pediatrics, nutrition, internal disorders, or diagnostic imaging.
{: #fs-id1257576}

To become a chiropractor, students must have 3–4 years of undergraduate
education, attend an accredited, four-year Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.)
degree program, and pass a licensure examination to be licensed for
practice in their state. With the aging of the baby-boom generation,
employment for chiropractors is expected to increase.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The vertebral column forms the neck and back. The vertebral column
originally develops as 33 vertebrae, but is eventually reduced to 24
vertebrae, plus the sacrum and coccyx. The vertebrae are divided into
the cervical region (C1–C7 vertebrae), the thoracic region (T1–T12
vertebrae), and the lumbar region (L1–L5 vertebrae). The sacrum arises
from the fusion of five sacral vertebrae and the coccyx from the fusion
of four small coccygeal vertebrae. The vertebral column has four
curvatures, the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacrococcygeal curves.
The thoracic and sacrococcygeal curves are primary curves retained from
the original fetal curvature. The cervical and lumbar curves develop
after birth and thus are secondary curves. The cervical curve develops
as the infant begins to hold up the head, and the lumbar curve appears
with standing and walking.
{: #fs-id1845434}

A typical vertebra consists of an enlarged anterior portion called the
body, which provides weight-bearing support. Attached posteriorly to the
body is a vertebral arch, which surrounds and defines the vertebral
foramen for passage of the spinal cord. The vertebral arch consists of
the pedicles, which attach to the vertebral body, and the laminae, which
come together to form the roof of the arch. Arising from the vertebral
arch are the laterally projecting transverse processes and the
posteriorly oriented spinous process. The superior articular processes
project upward, where they articulate with the downward projecting
inferior articular processes of the next higher vertebrae.
{: #fs-id1272225}

A typical cervical vertebra has a small body, a bifid (Y-shaped) spinous
process, and U-shaped transverse processes with a transverse foramen. In
addition to these characteristics, the axis (C2 vertebra) also has the
dens projecting upward from the vertebral body. The atlas (C1 vertebra)
differs from the other cervical vertebrae in that it does not have a
body, but instead consists of bony ring formed by the anterior and
posterior arches. The atlas articulates with the dens from the axis. A
typical thoracic vertebra is distinguished by its long, downward
projecting spinous process. Thoracic vertebrae also have articulation
facets on the body and transverse processes for attachment of the ribs.
Lumbar vertebrae support the greatest amount of body weight and thus
have a large, thick body. They also have a short, blunt spinous process.
The sacrum is triangular in shape. The median sacral crest is formed by
the fused vertebral spinous processes and the lateral sacral crest is
derived from the fused transverse processes. Anterior (ventral) and
posterior (dorsal) sacral foramina allow branches of the sacral spinal
nerves to exit the sacrum. The auricular surfaces are articulation sites
on the lateral sacrum that anchor the sacrum to the hipbones to form the
pelvis. The coccyx is small and derived from the fusion of four small
vertebrae.
{: #fs-id834077}

The intervertebral discs fill in the gaps between the bodies of adjacent
vertebrae. They provide strong attachments and padding between the
vertebrae. The outer, fibrous layer of a disc is called the anulus
fibrosus. The gel-like interior is called the nucleus pulposus. The disc
can change shape to allow for movement between vertebrae. If the anulus
fibrosus is weakened or damaged, the nucleus pulposus can protrude
outward, resulting in a herniated disc.
{: #fs-id1999423}

The anterior longitudinal ligament runs along the full length of the
anterior vertebral column, uniting the vertebral bodies. The
supraspinous ligament is located posteriorly and interconnects the
spinous processes of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. In the neck,
this ligament expands to become the nuchal ligament. The nuchal ligament
is attached to the cervical spinous processes and superiorly to the base
of the skull, out to the external occipital protuberance. The posterior
longitudinal ligament runs within the vertebral canal and unites the
posterior sides of the vertebral bodies. The ligamentum flavum unites
the lamina of adjacent vertebrae.
