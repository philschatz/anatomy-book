By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Compare the structure of somatic and autonomic reflex arcs

The autonomic nervous system regulates organ systems through circuits
that resemble the reflexes described in the somatic nervous system. The
main difference between the somatic and autonomic systems is in what
target tissues are effectors. Somatic responses are solely based on
skeletal muscle contraction. The autonomic system, however, targets
cardiac and smooth muscle, as well as glandular tissue. Whereas the
basic circuit is a <span data-type="term">reflex arc</span>, there are
differences in the structure of those reflexes for the somatic and
autonomic systems.

# The Structure of Reflexes
{: data-type="title"}

One difference between a <span data-type="term">somatic reflex</span>,
such as the withdrawal reflex, and a <span data-type="term">visceral
reflex</span>, which is an autonomic reflex, is in the <span
data-type="term">efferent branch</span>. The output of a somatic reflex
is the lower motor neuron in the ventral horn of the spinal cord that
projects directly to a skeletal muscle to cause its contraction. The
output of a visceral reflex is a two-step pathway starting with the
preganglionic fiber emerging from a lateral horn neuron in the spinal
cord, or a cranial nucleus neuron in the brain stem, to a
ganglion—followed by the postganglionic fiber projecting to a target
effector. The other part of a reflex, the <span
data-type="term">afferent branch</span>, is often the same between the
two systems. Sensory neurons receiving input from the periphery—with
cell bodies in the sensory ganglia, either of a cranial nerve or a
dorsal root ganglion adjacent to the spinal cord—project into the CNS to
initiate the reflex ([\[link\]](#fig-ch15_02_01){:
.autogenerated-content}). The Latin root “effere” means “to carry.”
Adding the prefix “ef-” suggests the meaning “to carry away,” whereas
adding the prefix “af-” suggests “to carry toward or inward.”

The afferent inputs to somatic and visceral reflexes are essentially the
same, whereas the efferent branches are different. Somatic reflexes, for
instance, involve a direct connection from the ventral horn of the
spinal cord to the skeletal muscle. Visceral reflexes involve a
projection from the central neuron to a ganglion, followed by a second
projection from the ganglion to the target effector.

## Afferent Branch
{: data-type="title"}

The afferent branch of a reflex arc does differ between somatic and
visceral reflexes in some instances. Many of the inputs to visceral
reflexes are from special or somatic senses, but particular senses are
associated with the viscera that are not part of the conscious
perception of the environment through the somatic nervous system. For
example, there is a specific type of mechanoreceptor, called a <span
data-type="term">baroreceptor</span>, in the walls of the aorta and
carotid sinuses that senses the stretch of those organs when blood
volume or pressure increases. You do not have a conscious perception of
having high blood pressure, but that is an important afferent branch of
the cardiovascular and, particularly, vasomotor reflexes. The sensory
neuron is essentially the same as any other general sensory neuron. The
baroreceptor apparatus is part of the ending of a unipolar neuron that
has a cell body in a sensory ganglion. The baroreceptors from the
carotid arteries have axons in the glossopharyngeal nerve, and those
from the aorta have axons in the vagus nerve.
{: #fs-id2455581}

Though visceral senses are not primarily a part of conscious perception,
those sensations sometimes make it to conscious awareness. If a visceral
sense is strong enough, it will be perceived. The sensory homunculus—the
representation of the body in the primary somatosensory cortex—only has
a small region allotted for the perception of internal stimuli. If you
swallow a large bolus of food, for instance, you will probably feel the
lump of that food as it pushes through your esophagus, or even if your
stomach is distended after a large meal. If you inhale especially cold
air, you can feel it as it enters your larynx and trachea. These
sensations are not the same as feeling high blood pressure or blood
sugar levels.
{: #fs-id2346435}

When particularly strong visceral sensations rise to the level of
conscious perception, the sensations are often felt in unexpected
places. For example, strong visceral sensations of the heart will be
felt as pain in the left shoulder and left arm. This irregular pattern
of projection of conscious perception of visceral sensations is called
<span data-type="term">referred pain</span>. Depending on the organ
system affected, the referred pain will project to different areas of
the body ([\[link\]](#fig-ch15_02_02){: .autogenerated-content}). The
location of referred pain is not random, but a definitive explanation of
the mechanism has not been established. The most broadly accepted theory
for this phenomenon is that the visceral sensory fibers enter into the
same level of the spinal cord as the somatosensory fibers of the
referred pain location. By this explanation, the visceral sensory fibers
from the mediastinal region, where the heart is located, would enter the
spinal cord at the same level as the spinal nerves from the shoulder and
arm, so the brain misinterprets the sensations from the mediastinal
region as being from the axillary and brachial regions. Projections from
the medial and inferior divisions of the cervical ganglia do enter the
spinal cord at the middle to lower cervical levels, which is where the
somatosensory fibers enter.

<span data-type="title">Nervous System: Kehr’s Sign</span> Kehr’s sign
is the presentation of pain in the left shoulder, chest, and neck
regions following rupture of the spleen. The spleen is in the upper-left
abdominopelvic quadrant, but the pain is more in the shoulder and neck.
How can this be? The sympathetic fibers connected to the spleen are from
the celiac ganglion, which would be from the mid-thoracic to lower
thoracic region whereas parasympathetic fibers are found in the vagus
nerve, which connects in the medulla of the brain stem. However, the
neck and shoulder would connect to the spinal cord at the mid-cervical
level of the spinal cord. These connections do not fit with the expected
correspondence of visceral and somatosensory fibers entering at the same
level of the spinal cord.
{: #fs-id2868061}

The incorrect assumption would be that the visceral sensations are
coming from the spleen directly. In fact, the visceral fibers are coming
from the diaphragm. The nerve connecting to the diaphragm takes a
special route. The phrenic nerve is connected to the spinal cord at
cervical levels 3 to 5. The motor fibers that make up this nerve are
responsible for the muscle contractions that drive ventilation. These
fibers have left the spinal cord to enter the phrenic nerve, meaning
that spinal cord damage below the mid-cervical level is not fatal by
making ventilation impossible. Therefore, the visceral fibers from the
diaphragm enter the spinal cord at the same level as the somatosensory
fibers from the neck and shoulder.
{: #fs-id2071373}

The diaphragm plays a role in Kehr’s sign because the spleen is just
inferior to the diaphragm in the upper-left quadrant of the
abdominopelvic cavity. When the spleen ruptures, blood spills into this
region. The accumulating hemorrhage then puts pressure on the diaphragm.
The visceral sensation is actually in the diaphragm, so the referred
pain is in a region of the body that corresponds to the diaphragm, not
the spleen.

## Efferent Branch
{: data-type="title"}

The efferent branch of the visceral reflex arc begins with the
projection from the central neuron along the preganglionic fiber. This
fiber then makes a synapse on the ganglionic neuron that projects to the
target effector.
{: #fs-id2459648}

The effector organs that are the targets of the autonomic system range
from the iris and ciliary body of the eye to the urinary bladder and
reproductive organs. The thoracolumbar output, through the various
sympathetic ganglia, reaches all of these organs. The cranial component
of the parasympathetic system projects from the eye to part of the
intestines. The sacral component picks up with the majority of the large
intestine and the pelvic organs of the urinary and reproductive systems.

## Short and Long Reflexes
{: data-type="title"}

Somatic reflexes involve sensory neurons that connect sensory receptors
to the CNS and motor neurons that project back out to the skeletal
muscles. Visceral reflexes that involve the thoracolumbar or
craniosacral systems share similar connections. However, there are
reflexes that do not need to involve any CNS components. A <span
data-type="term">long reflex</span> has afferent branches that enter the
spinal cord or brain and involve the efferent branches, as previously
explained. A <span data-type="term">short reflex</span> is completely
peripheral and only involves the local integration of sensory input with
motor output ([\[link\]](#fig-ch15_02_03){: .autogenerated-content}).
{: #fs-id2129527}

<figure id="fig-ch15_02_03">
<div data-type="title">
Short and Long Reflexes
</div>
<figcaption>
Sensory input can stimulate either a short or a long reflex. A sensory
neuron can project to the CNS or to an autonomic ganglion. The short
reflex involves the direct stimulation of a postganglionic fiber by the
sensory neuron, whereas the long reflex involves integration in the
spinal cord or brain.
</figcaption>
<span markdown="1" data-type="media" id="fs-id2339337" data-alt="The top panel in
this figure shows a long reflex, where the spinal cord is connected to
the sensory receptor cell and the peripheral ganglion. The bottom panel

data-media-type="image/jpg" width="520"} </span>
</figure>
The difference between short and long reflexes is in the involvement of
the CNS. Somatic reflexes always involve the CNS, even in a monosynaptic
reflex in which the sensory neuron directly activates the motor neuron.
That synapse is in the spinal cord or brain stem, so it has to involve
the CNS. However, in the autonomic system there is the possibility that
the CNS is not involved. Because the efferent branch of a visceral
reflex involves two neurons—the central neuron and the ganglionic
neuron—a “short circuit” can be possible. If a sensory neuron projects
directly to the ganglionic neuron and causes it to activate the effector
target, then the CNS is not involved.
{: #fs-id3087900}

A division of the nervous system that is related to the autonomic
nervous system is the enteric nervous system. The word enteric refers to
the digestive organs, so this represents the nervous tissue that is part
of the digestive system. There are a few myenteric plexuses in which the
nervous tissue in the wall of the digestive tract organs can directly
influence digestive function. If stretch receptors in the stomach are
activated by the filling and distension of the stomach, a short reflex
will directly activate the smooth muscle fibers of the stomach wall to
increase motility to digest the excessive food in the stomach. No CNS
involvement is needed because the stretch receptor is directly
activating a neuron in the wall of the stomach that causes the smooth
muscle to contract. That neuron, connected to the smooth muscle, is a
postganglionic parasympathetic neuron that can be controlled by a fiber
found in the vagus nerve.

# Balance in Competing Autonomic Reflex Arcs
{: data-type="title"}

The autonomic nervous system is important for homeostasis because its
two divisions compete at the target effector. The balance of homeostasis
is attributable to the competing inputs from the sympathetic and
parasympathetic divisions (dual innervation). At the level of the target
effector, the signal of which system is sending the message is strictly
chemical. A signaling molecule binds to a receptor that causes changes
in the target cell, which in turn causes the tissue or organ to respond
to the changing conditions of the body.
{: #fs-id2928016}

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2190675" markdown="1">
## Competing Neurotransmitters
{: data-type="title"}

The postganglionic fibers of the sympathetic and parasympathetic
divisions both release neurotransmitters that bind to receptors on their
targets. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine, with
a minor exception, whereas postganglionic parasympathetic fibers release
ACh. For any given target, the difference in which division of the
autonomic nervous system is exerting control is just in what chemical
binds to its receptors. The target cells will have adrenergic and
muscarinic receptors. If norepinephrine is released, it will bind to the
adrenergic receptors present on the target cell, and if ACh is released,
it will bind to the muscarinic receptors on the target cell.
{: #fs-id2990238}

In the sympathetic system, there are exceptions to this pattern of dual
innervation. The postganglionic sympathetic fibers that contact the
blood vessels within skeletal muscle and that contact sweat glands do
not release norepinephrine, they release ACh. This does not create any
problem because there is no parasympathetic input to the sweat glands.
Sweat glands have muscarinic receptors and produce and secrete sweat in
response to the presence of ACh.
{: #fs-id1602170}

At most of the other targets of the autonomic system, the effector
response is based on which neurotransmitter is released and what
receptor is present. For example, regions of the heart that establish
heart rate are contacted by postganglionic fibers from both systems. If
norepinephrine is released onto those cells, it binds to an adrenergic
receptor that causes the cells to depolarize faster, and the heart rate
increases. If ACh is released onto those cells, it binds to a muscarinic
receptor that causes the cells to hyperpolarize so that they cannot
reach threshold as easily, and the heart rate slows. Without this
parasympathetic input, the heart would work at a rate of approximately
100 beats per minute (bpm). The sympathetic system speeds that up, as it
would during exercise, to 120–140 bpm, for example. The parasympathetic
system slows it down to the resting heart rate of 60–80 bpm.
{: #fs-id2364402}

Another example is in the control of pupillary size
([\[link\]](#fig-ch15_02_04){: .autogenerated-content}). The afferent
branch responds to light hitting the retina. Photoreceptors are
activated, and the signal is transferred to the retinal ganglion cells
that send an action potential along the optic nerve into the
diencephalon. If light levels are low, the sympathetic system sends a
signal out through the upper thoracic spinal cord to the superior
cervical ganglion of the sympathetic chain. The postganglionic fiber
then projects to the iris, where it releases norepinephrine onto the
radial fibers of the iris (a smooth muscle). When those fibers contract,
the pupil dilates—increasing the amount of light hitting the retina. If
light levels are too high, the parasympathetic system sends a signal out
from the Eddinger–Westphal nucleus through the oculomotor nerve. This
fiber synapses in the ciliary ganglion in the posterior orbit. The
postganglionic fiber then projects to the iris, where it releases ACh
onto the circular fibers of the iris—another smooth muscle. When those
fibers contract, the pupil constricts to limit the amount of light
hitting the retina.

<figure id="fig-ch15_02_04">
<div data-type="title">
Autonomic Control of Pupillary Size
</div>
<figcaption>
Activation of the pupillary reflex comes from the amount of light
activating the retinal ganglion cells, as sent along the optic nerve.
The output of the sympathetic system projects through the superior
cervical ganglion, whereas the parasympathetic system originates out of
the midbrain and projects through the oculomotor nerve to the ciliary
ganglion, which then projects to the iris. The postganglionic fibers of
either division release neurotransmitters onto the smooth muscles of the
iris to cause changes in the pupillary size. Norepinephrine results in
dilation and ACh results in constriction.

In this example, the autonomic system is controlling how much light hits
the retina. It is a homeostatic reflex mechanism that keeps the
activation of photoreceptors within certain limits. In the context of
avoiding a threat like the lioness on the savannah, the sympathetic
response for fight or flight will increase pupillary diameter so that
more light hits the retina and more visual information is available for
running away. Likewise, the parasympathetic response of rest reduces the
amount of light reaching the retina, allowing the photoreceptors to
cycle through bleaching and be regenerated for further visual
perception; this is what the homeostatic process is attempting to
maintain.

## Autonomic Tone
{: data-type="title"}

Organ systems are balanced between the input from the sympathetic and
parasympathetic divisions. When something upsets that balance, the
homeostatic mechanisms strive to return it to its regular state. For
each organ system, there may be more of a sympathetic or parasympathetic
tendency to the resting state, which is known as the <span
data-type="term">autonomic tone</span> of the system. For example, the
heart rate was described above. Because the resting heart rate is the
result of the parasympathetic system slowing the heart down from its
intrinsic rate of 100 bpm, the heart can be said to be in
parasympathetic tone.
{: #fs-id1240825}

In a similar fashion, another aspect of the cardiovascular system is
primarily under sympathetic control. Blood pressure is partially
determined by the contraction of smooth muscle in the walls of blood
vessels. These tissues have adrenergic receptors that respond to the
release of norepinephrine from postganglionic sympathetic fibers by
constricting and increasing blood pressure. The hormones released from
the adrenal medulla—epinephrine and norepinephrine—will also bind to
these receptors. Those hormones travel through the bloodstream where
they can easily interact with the receptors in the vessel walls. The
parasympathetic system has no significant input to the systemic blood
vessels, so the sympathetic system determines their tone.
{: #fs-id2525262}

There are a limited number of blood vessels that respond to sympathetic
input in a different fashion. Blood vessels in skeletal muscle,
particularly those in the lower limbs, are more likely to dilate. It
does not have an overall effect on blood pressure to alter the tone of
the vessels, but rather allows for blood flow to increase for those
skeletal muscles that will be active in the fight-or-flight response.
The blood vessels that have a parasympathetic projection are limited to
those in the erectile tissue of the reproductive organs. Acetylcholine
released by these postganglionic parasympathetic fibers cause the
vessels to dilate, leading to the engorgement of the erectile tissue.

<div data-type="title">
Homeostatic Imbalances
</div>
<span data-type="title">Orthostatic Hypotension</span> Have you ever
stood up quickly and felt dizzy for a moment? This is because, for one
reason or another, blood is not getting to your brain so it is briefly
deprived of oxygen. When you change position from sitting or lying down
to standing, your cardiovascular system has to adjust for a new
challenge, keeping blood pumping up into the head while gravity is
pulling more and more blood down into the legs.
{: #fs-id2262542}

The reason for this is a sympathetic reflex that maintains the output of
the heart in response to postural change. When a person stands up,
proprioceptors indicate that the body is changing position. A signal
goes to the CNS, which then sends a signal to the upper thoracic spinal
cord neurons of the sympathetic division. The sympathetic system then
causes the heart to beat faster and the blood vessels to constrict. Both
changes will make it possible for the cardiovascular system to maintain
the rate of blood delivery to the brain. Blood is being pumped
superiorly through the internal branch of the carotid arteries into the
brain, against the force of gravity. Gravity is not increasing while
standing, but blood is more likely to flow down into the legs as they
are extended for standing. This sympathetic reflex keeps the brain well
oxygenated so that cognitive and other neural processes are not
interrupted.
{: #fs-id2676672}

Sometimes this does not work properly. If the sympathetic system cannot
increase cardiac output, then blood pressure into the brain will
decrease, and a brief neurological loss can be felt. This can be brief,
as a slight “wooziness” when standing up too quickly, or a loss of
balance and neurological impairment for a period of time. The name for
this is orthostatic hypotension, which means that blood pressure goes
below the homeostatic set point when standing. It can be the result of
standing up faster than the reflex can occur, which may be referred to
as a benign “head rush,” or it may be the result of an underlying cause.
{: #fs-id2463867}

There are two basic reasons that orthostatic hypotension can occur.
First, blood volume is too low and the sympathetic reflex is not
effective. This hypovolemia may be the result of dehydration or
medications that affect fluid balance, such as diuretics or
vasodilators. Both of these medications are meant to lower blood
pressure, which may be necessary in the case of systemic hypertension,
and regulation of the medications may alleviate the problem. Sometimes
increasing fluid intake or water retention through salt intake can
improve the situation.
{: #fs-id3088381}

The second underlying cause of orthostatic hypotension is autonomic
failure. There are several disorders that result in compromised
sympathetic functions. The disorders range from diabetes to multiple
system atrophy (a loss of control over many systems in the body), and
addressing the underlying condition can improve the hypotension. For
example, with diabetes, peripheral nerve damage can occur, which would
affect the postganglionic sympathetic fibers. Getting blood glucose
levels under control can improve neurological deficits associated with
diabetes.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

Autonomic nervous system function is based on the visceral reflex. This
reflex is similar to the somatic reflex, but the efferent branch is
composed of two neurons. The central neuron projects from the spinal
cord or brain stem to synapse on the ganglionic neuron that projects to
the effector. The afferent branch of the somatic and visceral reflexes
is very similar, as many somatic and special senses activate autonomic
responses. However, there are visceral senses that do not form part of
conscious perception. If a visceral sensation, such as cardiac pain, is
strong enough, it will rise to the level of consciousness. However, the
sensory homunculus does not provide a representation of the internal
structures to the same degree as the surface of the body, so visceral
sensations are often experienced as referred pain, such as feelings of
pain in the left shoulder and arm in connection with a heart attack.
{: #fs-id2627237}

The role of visceral reflexes is to maintain a balance of function in
the organ systems of the body. The two divisions of the autonomic system
each play a role in effecting change, usually in competing directions.
The sympathetic system increases heart rate, whereas the parasympathetic
system decreases heart rate. The sympathetic system dilates the pupil of
the eye, whereas the parasympathetic system constricts the pupil. The
competing inputs can contribute to the resting tone of the organ system.
Heart rate is normally under parasympathetic tone, whereas blood
pressure is normally under sympathetic tone. The heart rate is slowed by
the autonomic system at rest, whereas blood vessels retain a slight
constriction at rest.
{: #fs-id2366801}

In a few systems of the body, the competing input from the two divisions
is not the norm. The sympathetic tone of blood vessels is caused by the
lack of parasympathetic input to the systemic circulatory system. Only
certain regions receive parasympathetic input that relaxes the smooth
muscle wall of the blood vessels. Sweat glands are another example,
which only receive input from the sympathetic system.

Watch this [video][2] to learn about the pupillary reflexes. The
pupillary light reflex involves sensory input through the optic nerve
and motor response through the oculomotor nerve to the ciliary ganglion,
which projects to the circular fibers of the iris. As shown in this
short animation, pupils will constrict to limit the amount of light
falling on the retina under bright lighting conditions. What constitutes
the afferent and efferent branches of the competing reflex (dilation)?

The optic nerve still carries the afferent input, but the output is from
the thoracic spinal cord, through the superior cervical ganglion, to the
radial fibers of the iris.

Damage to internal organs will present as pain associated with a
particular surface area of the body. Why would something like irritation
to the diaphragm, which is between the thoracic and abdominal cavities,
feel like pain in the shoulder or neck?
{: #fs-id2281902}

</div>
<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id1475566" data-label="" markdown="1">
The nerves that carry sensory information from the diaphragm enter the
spinal cord in the cervical region where somatic sensory fibers from the
shoulder and neck would enter. The brain superimposes this experience
onto the sensory homunculus where the somatic nerves are connected.

Medical practice is paying more attention to the autonomic system in
considering disease states. Why would autonomic tone be important in
considering cardiovascular disease?
{: #fs-id1850120}

</div>
<div data-type="solution" id="fs-id1479478" data-label="" markdown="1">
Within the cardiovascular system, different aspects demonstrate
variation in autonomic tone. Heart rate is under parasympathetic tone,
and blood pressure is under sympathetic tone. Pharmaceuticals that treat
cardiovascular disorders may be more effective if they work with the
normal state of the autonomic system. Alternatively, some disorders may
be exacerbated by autonomic deficits and common therapies might not be
as effective.
