We have discussed the events that lead to the development of a newborn.
But what makes each newborn unique? The answer lies, of course, in the
DNA in the sperm and oocyte that combined to produce that first diploid
cell, the human zygote.

# From Genotype to Phenotype
{: data-type="title"}

Each human body cell has a full complement of DNA stored in 23 pairs of
chromosomes. [\[link\]](#fig-ch29_07_01){: .autogenerated-content} shows
the pairs in a systematic arrangement called a <span
data-type="term">karyotype</span>. Among these is one pair of
chromosomes, called the <span data-type="term">sex chromosomes</span>,
that determines the sex of the individual (XX in females, XY in males).
The remaining 22 chromosome pairs are called <span
data-type="term">autosomal chromosomes</span>. Each of these chromosomes
carries hundreds or even thousands of genes, each of which codes for the
assembly of a particular protein—that is, genes are “expressed” as
proteins. An individual’s complete genetic makeup is referred to as his
or her <span data-type="term">genotype</span>. The characteristics that
the genes express, whether they are physical, behavioral, or
biochemical, are a person’s <span data-type="term">phenotype</span>.
{: #fs-id1472722}

You inherit one chromosome in each pair—a full complement of 23—from
each parent. This occurs when the sperm and oocyte combine at the moment
of your conception. Homologous chromosomes—those that make up a
complementary pair—have genes for the same characteristics in the same
location on the chromosome. Because one copy of a gene, an <span
data-type="term">allele</span>, is inherited from each parent, the
alleles in these complementary pairs may vary. Take for example an
allele that encodes for dimples. A child may inherit the allele encoding
for dimples on the chromosome from the father and the allele that
encodes for smooth skin (no dimples) on the chromosome from the mother.

Although a person can have two identical alleles for a single gene (a
<span data-type="term">homozygous</span> state), it is also possible for
a person to have two different alleles (a <span
data-type="term">heterozygous</span> state). The two alleles can
interact in several different ways. The expression of an allele can be
dominant, for which the activity of this gene will mask the expression
of a nondominant, or recessive, allele. Sometimes dominance is complete;
at other times, it is incomplete. In some cases, both alleles are
expressed at the same time in a form of expression known as codominance.
{: #fs-id1699605}

In the simplest scenario, a single pair of genes will determine a single
heritable characteristic. However, it is quite common for multiple genes
to interact to confer a feature. For instance, eight or more genes—each
with their own alleles—determine eye color in humans. Moreover, although
any one person can only have two alleles corresponding to a given gene,
more than two alleles commonly exist in a population. This phenomenon is
called multiple alleles. For example, there are three different alleles
that encode ABO blood type; these are designated <em
data-effect="italics">I<sup>A</sup>, I<sup>B</sup>, </em>and *i.*{:

Over 100 years of theoretical and experimental genetics studies, and the
more recent sequencing and annotation of the human genome, have helped
scientists to develop a better understanding of how an individual’s
genotype is expressed as their phenotype. This body of knowledge can
help scientists and medical professionals to predict, or at least
estimate, some of the features that an offspring will inherit by
examining the genotypes or phenotypes of the parents. One important
application of this knowledge is to identify an individual’s risk for
certain heritable genetic disorders. However, most diseases have a
multigenic pattern of inheritance and can also be affected by the
environment, so examining the genotypes or phenotypes of a person’s
parents will provide only limited information about the risk of
inheriting a disease. Only for a handful of single-gene disorders can
genetic testing allow clinicians to calculate the probability with which
a child born to the two parents tested may inherit a specific disease.

# Mendel’s Theory of Inheritance
{: data-type="title"}

Our contemporary understanding of genetics rests on the work of a
nineteenth-century monk. Working in the mid-1800s, long before anyone
knew about genes or chromosomes, Gregor Mendel discovered that garden
peas transmit their physical characteristics to subsequent generations
in a discrete and predictable fashion. When he mated, or crossed, two
pure-breeding pea plants that differed by a certain characteristic, the
first-generation offspring all looked like one of the parents. For
instance, when he crossed tall and dwarf pure-breeding pea plants, all
of the offspring were tall. Mendel called tallness <span
data-type="term">dominant</span> because it was expressed in offspring
when it was present in a purebred parent. He called dwarfism <span
data-type="term">recessive</span> because it was masked in the offspring
if one of the purebred parents possessed the dominant characteristic.
Note that tallness and dwarfism are variations on the characteristic of
height. Mendel called such a variation a <span
data-type="term">trait</span>. We now know that these traits are the
expression of different alleles of the gene encoding height.
{: #fs-id2614547}

Mendel performed thousands of crosses in pea plants with differing
traits for a variety of characteristics. And he repeatedly came up with
the same results—among the traits he studied, one was always dominant,
and the other was always recessive. (Remember, however, that this
dominant–recessive relationship between alleles is not always the case;
some alleles are codominant, and sometimes dominance is incomplete.)
{: #fs-id2524252}

Using his understanding of dominant and recessive traits, Mendel tested
whether a recessive trait could be lost altogether in a pea lineage or
whether it would resurface in a later generation. By crossing the
second-generation offspring of purebred parents with each other, he
showed that the latter was true: recessive traits reappeared in
third-generation plants in a ratio of 3:1 (three offspring having the
dominant trait and one having the recessive trait). Mendel then proposed
that characteristics such as height were determined by heritable
“factors” that were transmitted, one from each parent, and inherited in
pairs by offspring.
{: #fs-id1947052}

In the language of genetics, Mendel’s theory applied to humans says that
if an individual receives two dominant alleles, one from each parent,
the individual’s phenotype will express the dominant trait. If an
individual receives two recessive alleles, then the recessive trait will
be expressed in the phenotype. Individuals who have two identical
alleles for a given gene, whether dominant or recessive, are said to be
homozygous for that gene (homo- = “same”). Conversely, an individual who
has one dominant allele and one recessive allele is said to be
heterozygous for that gene (hetero- = “different” or “other”). In this
case, the dominant trait will be expressed, and the individual will be
phenotypically identical to an individual who possesses two dominant
alleles for the trait.
{: #fs-id1708517}

It is common practice in genetics to use capital and lowercase letters
to represent dominant and recessive alleles. Using Mendel’s pea plants
as an example, if a tall pea plant is homozygous, it will possess two
tall alleles (*TT*{: data-effect="italics"}). A dwarf pea plant must be
homozygous because its dwarfism can only be expressed when two recessive
alleles are present (*tt*{: data-effect="italics"}). A heterozygous pea
plant (*Tt*{: data-effect="italics"}) would be tall and phenotypically
indistinguishable from a tall homozygous pea plant because of the
dominant tall allele. Mendel deduced that a 3:1 ratio of dominant to
recessive would be produced by the random segregation of heritable
factors (genes) when crossing two heterozygous pea plants. In other
words, for any given gene, parents are equally likely to pass down
either one of their alleles to their offspring in a haploid gamete, and
the result will be expressed in a dominant–recessive pattern if both
parents are heterozygous for the trait.
{: #fs-id2142336}

Because of the random segregation of gametes, the laws of chance and
probability come into play when predicting the likelihood of a given
phenotype. Consider a cross between an individual with two dominant
alleles for a trait (*AA*{: data-effect="italics"}) and an individual
with two recessive alleles for the same trait (*aa*{:
data-effect="italics"}). All of the parental gametes from the dominant
individual would be *A*{: data-effect="italics"}, and all of the
parental gametes from the recessive individual would be *a*{:
data-effect="italics"} ([\[link\]](#fig-ch29_07_02){:
.autogenerated-content}). All of the offspring of that second
generation, inheriting one allele from each parent, would have the
genotype *Aa*{: data-effect="italics"}, and the probability of
expressing the phenotype of the dominant allele would be 4 out of 4, or
100 percent.
{: #fs-id1640387}

This seems simple enough, but the inheritance pattern gets interesting
when the second-generation *Aa*{: data-effect="italics"} individuals are
crossed. In this generation, 50 percent of each parent’s gametes are
*A*{: data-effect="italics"} and the other 50 percent are *a*{:
data-effect="italics"}. By Mendel’s principle of random segregation, the
possible combinations of gametes that the offspring can receive are
*AA*{: data-effect="italics"}, *Aa*{: data-effect="italics"}, *aA*{:
data-effect="italics"} (which is the same as *Aa*{:
data-effect="italics"}), and *aa*{: data-effect="italics"}. Because
segregation and fertilization are random, each offspring has a 25
percent chance of receiving any of these combinations. Therefore, if an
*Aa*{: data-effect="italics"} × *Aa*{: data-effect="italics"} cross were
performed 1000 times, approximately 250 (25 percent) of the offspring
would be *AA*{: data-effect="italics"}; 500 (50 percent) would be *Aa*{:
data-effect="italics"} (that is, *Aa*{: data-effect="italics"} plus
*aA*{: data-effect="italics"}); and 250 (25 percent) would be *aa*{:
data-effect="italics"}. The genotypic ratio for this inheritance pattern
is 1:2:1. However, we have already established that <em
data-effect="italics">AA </em>and <em data-effect="italics">Aa </em>(and
*aA*{: data-effect="italics"}) individuals all express the dominant
trait (i.e., share the same phenotype), and can therefore be combined
into one group. The result is Mendel’s third-generation phenotype ratio
of 3:1.

In the formation of gametes, it is equally likely that either one of a
pair alleles from one parent will be passed on to the offspring. This
figure follows the possible combinations of alleles through two
generations following a first-generation cross of homozygous dominant
and homozygous recessive parents. The recessive phenotype, which is
masked in the second generation, has a 1 in 4, or 25 percent, chance of
reappearing in the third generation.

</figure>
Mendel’s observation of pea plants also included many crosses that
involved multiple traits, which prompted him to formulate the principle
of independent assortment. The law states that the members of one pair
of genes (alleles) from a parent will sort independently from other
pairs of genes during the formation of gametes. Applied to pea plants,
that means that the alleles associated with the different traits of the
plant, such as color, height, or seed type, will sort independently of
one another. This holds true except when two alleles happen to be
located close to one other on the same chromosome. Independent
assortment provides for a great degree of diversity in offspring.
{: #fs-id1404418}

Mendelian genetics represent the fundamentals of inheritance, but there
are two important qualifiers to consider when applying Mendel’s findings
to inheritance studies in humans. First, as we’ve already noted, not all
genes are inherited in a dominant–recessive pattern. Although all
diploid individuals have two alleles for every gene, allele pairs may
interact to create several types of inheritance patterns, including
incomplete dominance and codominance.
{: #fs-id2065673}

Secondly, Mendel performed his studies using thousands of pea plants. He
was able to identify a 3:1 phenotypic ratio in second-generation
offspring because his large sample size overcame the influence of
variability resulting from chance. In contrast, no human couple has ever
had thousands of children. If we know that a man and woman are both
heterozygous for a recessive genetic disorder, we would predict that one
in every four of their children would be affected by the disease. In
real life, however, the influence of chance could change that ratio
significantly. For example, if a man and a woman are both heterozygous
for cystic fibrosis, a recessive genetic disorder that is expressed only
when the individual has two defective alleles, we would expect one in
four of their children to have cystic fibrosis. However, it is entirely
possible for them to have seven children, none of whom is affected, or
for them to have two children, both of whom are affected. For each
individual child, the presence or absence of a single gene disorder
depends on which alleles that child inherits from his or her parents.
{: #fs-id1277237}

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2430451" markdown="1">
# Autosomal Dominant Inheritance
{: data-type="title"}

In the case of cystic fibrosis, the disorder is recessive to the normal
phenotype. However, a genetic abnormality may be dominant to the normal
phenotype. When the dominant allele is located on one of the 22 pairs of
autosomes (non-sex chromosomes), we refer to its inheritance pattern as
<span data-type="term">autosomal dominant</span>. An example of an
autosomal dominant disorder is neurofibromatosis type I, a disease that
induces tumor formation within the nervous system that leads to skin and
skeletal deformities. Consider a couple in which one parent is
heterozygous for this disorder (and who therefore has
neurofibromatosis), *Nn*{: data-effect="italics"}, and one parent is
homozygous for the normal gene, *nn*{: data-effect="italics"}. The
heterozygous parent would have a 50 percent chance of passing the
dominant allele for this disorder to his or her offspring, and the
homozygous parent would always pass the normal allele. Therefore, four
possible offspring genotypes are equally likely to occur: *Nn*{:
data-effect="italics"}, *Nn*{: data-effect="italics"}, *nn*{:
data-effect="italics"}, and *nn*{: data-effect="italics"}. That is,
every child of this couple would have a 50 percent chance of inheriting
neurofibromatosis. This inheritance pattern is shown in
[\[link\]](#fig-ch29_07_03){: .autogenerated-content}, in a form called
a <span data-type="term">Punnett square</span>, named after its creator,
the British geneticist Reginald Punnett.

</figure>
Other genetic diseases that are inherited in this pattern are
achondroplastic dwarfism, Marfan syndrome, and Huntington’s disease.
Because autosomal dominant disorders are expressed by the presence of
just one gene, an individual with the disorder will know that he or she
has at least one faulty gene. The expression of the disease may manifest
later in life, after the childbearing years, which is the case in
Huntington’s disease (discussed in more detail later in this section).

# Autosomal Recessive Inheritance
{: data-type="title"}

When a genetic disorder is inherited in an <span
data-type="term">autosomal recessive</span> pattern, the disorder
corresponds to the recessive phenotype. Heterozygous individuals will
not display symptoms of this disorder, because their unaffected gene
will compensate. Such an individual is called a <span
data-type="term">carrier</span>. Carriers for an autosomal recessive
disorder may never know their genotype unless they have a child with the
disorder.
{: #fs-id1387600}

An example of an autosomal recessive disorder is cystic fibrosis (CF),
which we introduced earlier. CF is characterized by the chronic
accumulation of a thick, tenacious mucus in the lungs and digestive
tract. Decades ago, children with CF rarely lived to adulthood. With
advances in medical technology, the average lifespan in developed
countries has increased into middle adulthood. CF is a relatively common
disorder that occurs in approximately 1 in 2000 Caucasians. A child born
to two CF carriers would have a 25 percent chance of inheriting the
disease. This is the same 3:1 dominant:recessive ratio that Mendel
observed in his pea plants would apply here. The pattern is shown in
[\[link\]](#fig-ch29_07_04){: .autogenerated-content}, using a diagram
that tracks the likely incidence of an autosomal recessive disorder on
the basis of parental genotypes.
{: #fs-id1277185}

On the other hand, a child born to a CF carrier and someone with two
unaffected alleles would have a 0 percent probability of inheriting CF,
but would have a 50 percent chance of being a carrier. Other examples of
autosome recessive genetic illnesses include the blood disorder
sickle-cell anemia, the fatal neurological disorder Tay–Sachs disease,
and the metabolic disorder phenylketonuria.

# X-linked Dominant or Recessive Inheritance
{: data-type="title"}

An <span data-type="term">X-linked</span> transmission pattern involves
genes located on the X chromosome of the 23rd pair
([\[link\]](#fig-ch29_07_05){: .autogenerated-content}). Recall that a
male has one X and one Y chromosome. When a father transmits a Y
chromosome, the child is male, and when he transmits an X chromosome,
the child is female. A mother can transmit only an X chromosome, as both
her sex chromosomes are X chromosomes.
{: #fs-id1521996}

When an abnormal allele for a gene that occurs on the X chromosome is
dominant over the normal allele, the pattern is described as <span
data-type="term">X-linked dominant</span>. This is the case with vitamin
D–resistant rickets: an affected father would pass the disease gene to
all of his daughters, but none of his sons, because he donates only the
Y chromosome to his sons (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch29_07_05){:
.autogenerated-content}**a**{: data-effect="bold"}). If it is the mother
who is affected, all of her children—male or female—would have a 50
percent chance of inheriting the disorder because she can only pass an X
chromosome on to her children (see [\[link\]](#fig-ch29_07_05){:
.autogenerated-content}**b**{: data-effect="bold"}). For an affected
female, the inheritance pattern would be identical to that of an
autosomal dominant inheritance pattern in which one parent is
heterozygous and the other is homozygous for the normal gene.

<span data-type="term">X-linked recessive</span> inheritance is much
more common because females can be carriers of the disease yet still
have a normal phenotype. Diseases transmitted by X-linked recessive
inheritance include color blindness, the blood-clotting disorder
hemophilia, and some forms of muscular dystrophy. For an example of
X-linked recessive inheritance, consider parents in which the mother is
an unaffected carrier and the father is normal. None of the daughters
would have the disease because they receive a normal gene from their
father. However, they have a 50 percent chance of receiving the disease
gene from their mother and becoming a carrier. In contrast, 50 percent
of the sons would be affected ([\[link\]](#fig-ch29_07_06){:

{: #fs-id2169393}

With X-linked recessive diseases, males either have the disease or are
genotypically normal—they cannot be carriers. Females, however, can be
genotypically normal, a carrier who is phenotypically normal, or
affected with the disease. A daughter can inherit the gene for an
X-linked recessive illness when her mother is a carrier or affected, or
her father is affected. The daughter will be affected by the disease
only if she inherits an X-linked recessive gene from both parents. As
you can imagine, X-linked recessive disorders affect many more males
than females. For example, color blindness affects at least 1 in 20
males, but only about 1 in 400 females.

# Other Inheritance Patterns: Incomplete Dominance, Codominance, and Lethal Alleles
{: data-type="title"}

Not all genetic disorders are inherited in a dominant–recessive pattern.
In <span data-type="term">incomplete dominance</span>, the offspring
express a heterozygous phenotype that is intermediate between one
parent’s homozygous dominant trait and the other parent’s homozygous
recessive trait. An example of this can be seen in snapdragons when
red-flowered plants and white-flowered plants are crossed to produce
pink-flowered plants. In humans, incomplete dominance occurs with one of
the genes for hair texture. When one parent passes a curly hair allele
(the incompletely dominant allele) and the other parent passes a
straight-hair allele, the effect on the offspring will be intermediate,
resulting in hair that is wavy.
{: #fs-id1699632}

<span data-type="term">Codominance</span> is characterized by the equal,
distinct, and simultaneous expression of both parents’ different
alleles. This pattern differs from the intermediate, blended features
seen in incomplete dominance. A classic example of codominance in humans
is ABO blood type. People are blood type A if they have an allele for an
enzyme that facilitates the production of surface antigen A on their
erythrocytes. This allele is designated *I<sup>A</sup>*{:
data-effect="italics"}. In the same manner, people are blood type B if
they express an enzyme for the production of surface antigen B. People
who have alleles for both enzymes (*I<sup>A</sup>*{:
data-effect="italics"} and *I<sup>B</sup>*{: data-effect="italics"})
produce both surface antigens A and B. As a result, they are blood type
AB. Because the effect of both alleles (or enzymes) is observed, we say
that the *I<sup>A</sup>*{: data-effect="italics"} and *I<sup>B</sup>*{:
data-effect="italics"} alleles are codominant. There is also a third
allele that determines blood type. This allele (*i*{:
data-effect="italics"}) produces a nonfunctional enzyme. People who have
two *i*{: data-effect="italics"} alleles do not produce either A or B
surface antigens: they have type O blood. If a person has
*I<sup>A</sup>*{: data-effect="italics"} and<em data-effect="italics">
i</em> alleles, the person will have blood type A. Notice that it does
not make any difference whether a person has two<em
data-effect="italics"> I<sup>A</sup></em> alleles or one
*I<sup>A</sup>*{: data-effect="italics"} and one *i*{:
data-effect="italics"} allele. In both cases, the person is blood type
A. Because *I<sup>A</sup>*{: data-effect="italics"} masks *i*{:

Certain combinations of alleles can be lethal, meaning they prevent the
individual from developing in utero, or cause a shortened life span. In
<span data-type="term">recessive lethal</span> inheritance patterns, a
child who is born to two heterozygous (carrier) parents and who
inherited the faulty allele from both would not survive. An example of
this is Tay–Sachs, a fatal disorder of the nervous system. In this
disorder, parents with one copy of the allele for the disorder are
carriers. If they both transmit their abnormal allele, their offspring
will develop the disease and will die in childhood, usually before age
5.
{: #fs-id1753238}

<span data-type="term">Dominant lethal</span> inheritance patterns are
much more rare because neither heterozygotes nor homozygotes survive. Of
course, dominant lethal alleles that arise naturally through mutation
and cause miscarriages or stillbirths are never transmitted to
subsequent generations. However, some dominant lethal alleles, such as
the allele for Huntington’s disease, cause a shortened life span but may
not be identified until after the person reaches reproductive age and
has children. Huntington’s disease causes irreversible nerve cell
degeneration and death in 100 percent of affected individuals, but it
may not be expressed until the individual reaches middle age. In this
way, dominant lethal alleles can be maintained in the human population.
Individuals with a family history of Huntington’s disease are typically
offered genetic counseling, which can help them decide whether or not
they wish to be tested for the faulty gene.

# Mutations
{: data-type="title"}

A <span data-type="term">mutation</span> is a change in the sequence of
DNA nucleotides that may or may not affect a person’s phenotype.
Mutations can arise spontaneously from errors during DNA replication, or
they can result from environmental insults such as radiation, certain
viruses, or exposure to tobacco smoke or other toxic chemicals. Because
genes encode for the assembly of proteins, a mutation in the nucleotide
sequence of a gene can change amino acid sequence and, consequently, a
protein’s structure and function. Spontaneous mutations occurring during
meiosis are thought to account for many spontaneous abortions
(miscarriages).

# Chromosomal Disorders
{: data-type="title"}

Sometimes a genetic disease is not caused by a mutation in a gene, but
by the presence of an incorrect number of chromosomes. For example, Down
syndrome is caused by having three copies of chromosome 21. This is
known as trisomy 21. The most common cause of trisomy 21 is chromosomal
nondisjunction during meiosis. The frequency of nondisjunction events
appears to increase with age, so the frequency of bearing a child with
Down syndrome increases in women over 36. The age of the father matters
less because nondisjunction is much less likely to occur in a sperm than
in an egg.
{: #fs-id1886823}

Whereas Down syndrome is caused by having three copies of a chromosome,
Turner syndrome is caused by having just one copy of the X chromosome.
This is known as monosomy. The affected child is always female. Women
with Turner syndrome are sterile because their sexual organs do not
mature.

<span data-type="title">Genetic Counselor</span> Given the intricate
orchestration of gene expression, cell migration, and cell
differentiation during prenatal development, it is amazing that the vast
majority of newborns are healthy and free of major birth defects. When a
woman over 35 is pregnant or intends to become pregnant, or her partner
is over 55, or if there is a family history of a genetic disorder, she
and her partner may want to speak to a genetic counselor to discuss the
likelihood that their child may be affected by a genetic or chromosomal
disorder. A genetic counselor can interpret a couple’s family history
and estimate the risks to their future offspring.
{: #fs-id2328067}

For many genetic diseases, a DNA test can determine whether a person is
a carrier. For instance, carrier status for Fragile X, an X-linked
disorder associated with mental retardation, or for cystic fibrosis can
be determined with a simple blood draw to obtain DNA for testing. A
genetic counselor can educate a couple about the implications of such a
test and help them decide whether to undergo testing. For chromosomal
disorders, the available testing options include a blood test,
amniocentesis (in which amniotic fluid is tested), and chorionic villus
sampling (in which tissue from the placenta is tested). Each of these
has advantages and drawbacks. A genetic counselor can also help a couple
cope with the news that either one or both partners is a carrier of a
genetic illness, or that their unborn child has been diagnosed with a
chromosomal disorder or other birth defect.
{: #fs-id1904132}

To become a genetic counselor, one needs to complete a 4-year
undergraduate program and then obtain a Master of Science in Genetic
Counseling from an accredited university. Board certification is
attained after passing examinations by the American Board of Genetic
Counseling. Genetic counselors are essential professionals in many
branches of medicine, but there is a particular demand for preconception
and prenatal genetic counselors.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

There are two aspects to a person’s genetic makeup. Their genotype
refers to the genetic makeup of the chromosomes found in all their cells
and the alleles that are passed down from their parents. Their phenotype
is the expression of that genotype, based on the interaction of the
paired alleles, as well as how environmental conditions affect that
expression.
{: #fs-id1526524}

Working with pea plants, Mendel discovered that the factors that account
for different traits in parents are discretely transmitted to offspring
in pairs, one from each parent. He articulated the principles of random
segregation and independent assortment to account for the inheritance
patterns he observed. Mendel’s factors are genes, with differing
variants being referred to as alleles and those alleles being dominant
or recessive in expression. Each parent passes one allele for every gene
on to offspring, and offspring are equally likely to inherit any
combination of allele pairs. When Mendel crossed heterozygous
individuals, he repeatedly found a 3:1 dominant–recessive ratio. He
correctly postulated that the expression of the recessive trait was
masked in heterozygotes but would resurface in their offspring in a
predictable manner.
{: #fs-id2340546}

Human genetics focuses on identifying different alleles and
understanding how they express themselves. Medical researchers are
especially interested in the identification of inheritance patterns for
genetic disorders, which provides the means to estimate the risk that a
given couple’s offspring will inherit a genetic disease or disorder.
Patterns of inheritance in humans include autosomal dominance and
recessiveness, X-linked dominance and recessiveness, incomplete
dominance, codominance, and lethality. A change in the nucleotide
sequence of DNA, which may or may not manifest in a phenotype, is called
a mutation.
