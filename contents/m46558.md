Antibodies were the first component of the adaptive immune response to
be characterized by scientists working on the immune system. It was
already known that individuals who survived a bacterial infection were
immune to re-infection with the same pathogen. Early microbiologists
took serum from an immune patient and mixed it with a fresh culture of
the same type of bacteria, then observed the bacteria under a
microscope. The bacteria became clumped in a process called
agglutination. When a different bacterial species was used, the
agglutination did not happen. Thus, there was something in the serum of
immune individuals that could specifically bind to and agglutinate
bacteria.
{: #fs-id1433157}

Scientists now know the cause of the agglutination is an antibody
molecule, also called an <span data-type="term">immunoglobulin</span>.
What is an antibody? An antibody protein is essentially a secreted form
of a B cell receptor. (In fact, surface immunoglobulin is another name
for the B cell receptor.) Not surprisingly, the same genes encode both
the secreted antibodies and the surface immunoglobulins. One minor
difference in the way these proteins are synthesized distinguishes a
naïve B cell with antibody on its surface from an antibody-secreting
plasma cell with no antibodies on its surface. The antibodies of the
plasma cell have the exact same antigen-binding site and specificity as
their B cell precursors.
{: #fs-id1855302}

There are five different classes of antibody found in humans: IgM, IgD,
IgG, IgA, and IgE. Each of these has specific functions in the immune
response, so by learning about them, researchers can learn about the
great variety of antibody functions critical to many adaptive immune
responses.
{: #fs-id1489212}

B cells do not recognize antigen in the complex fashion of T cells. B
cells can recognize native, unprocessed antigen and do not require the
participation of MHC molecules and antigen-presenting cells.

# B Cell Differentiation and Activation
{: data-type="title"}

B cells differentiate in the bone marrow. During the process of
maturation, up to 100 trillion different clones of B cells are
generated, which is similar to the diversity of antigen receptors seen
in T cells.
{: #fs-id1891790}

B cell differentiation and the development of tolerance are not quite as
well understood as it is in T cells. <span data-type="term">Central
tolerance</span> is the destruction or inactivation of B cells that
recognize self-antigens in the bone marrow, and its role is critical and
well established. In the process of <span data-type="term">clonal
deletion</span>, immature B cells that bind strongly to self-antigens
expressed on tissues are signaled to commit suicide by apoptosis,
removing them from the population. In the process of <span
data-type="term">clonal anergy</span>, however, B cells exposed to
soluble antigen in the bone marrow are not physically deleted, but
become unable to function.
{: #fs-id1882242}

Another mechanism called peripheral tolerance is a direct result of T
cell tolerance. In <span data-type="term">peripheral tolerance</span>,
functional, mature B cells leave the bone marrow but have yet to be
exposed to self-antigen. Most protein antigens require signals from
helper T cells (Th2) to proceed to make antibody. When a B cell binds to
a self-antigen but receives no signals from a nearby Th2 cell to produce
antibody, the cell is signaled to undergo apoptosis and is destroyed.
This is yet another example of the control that T cells have over the
adaptive immune response.
{: #fs-id1489561}

After B cells are activated by their binding to antigen, they
differentiate into plasma cells. Plasma cells often leave the secondary
lymphoid organs, where the response is generated, and migrate back to
the bone marrow, where the whole differentiation process started. After
secreting antibodies for a specific period, they die, as most of their
energy is devoted to making antibodies and not to maintaining
themselves. Thus, plasma cells are said to be terminally differentiated.
{: #fs-id1907767}

The final B cell of interest is the memory B cell, which results from
the clonal expansion of an activated B cell. Memory B cells function in
a way similar to memory T cells. They lead to a stronger and faster
secondary response when compared to the primary response, as illustrated
below.

# Antibody Structure
{: data-type="title"}

Antibodies are glycoproteins consisting of two types of polypeptide
chains with attached carbohydrates. The <span data-type="term">heavy
chain</span> and the <span data-type="term">light chain</span> are the
two polypeptides that form the antibody. The main differences between
the classes of antibodies are in the differences between their heavy
chains, but as you shall see, the light chains have an important role,
forming part of the antigen-binding site on the antibody molecules.
{: #fs-id2308482}

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2650512" markdown="1">
## Four-chain Models of Antibody Structures
{: data-type="title"}

All antibody molecules have two identical heavy chains and two identical
light chains. (Some antibodies contain multiple units of this four-chain
structure.) The <span data-type="term">Fc region</span> of the antibody
is formed by the two heavy chains coming together, usually linked by
disulfide bonds ([\[link\]](#fig-ch22_04_01){: .autogenerated-content}).
The Fc portion of the antibody is important in that many effector cells
of the immune system have Fc receptors. Cells having these receptors can
then bind to antibody-coated pathogens, greatly increasing the
specificity of the effector cells. At the other end of the molecule are
two identical antigen-binding sites.

## Five Classes of Antibodies and their Functions
{: data-type="title"}

In general, antibodies have two basic functions. They can act as the B
cell antigen receptor or they can be secreted, circulate, and bind to a
pathogen, often labeling it for identification by other forms of the
immune response. Of the five antibody classes, notice that only two can
function as the antigen receptor for naïve B cells: IgM and <span
data-type="term">IgD</span> ([\[link\]](#fig-ch22_04_02){:
.autogenerated-content}). Mature B cells that leave the bone marrow
express both IgM and IgD, but both antibodies have the same antigen
specificity. Only IgM is secreted, however, and no other nonreceptor
function for IgD has been discovered.

</figure>
<span data-type="term">IgM</span> consists of five four-chain structures
(20 total chains with 10 identical antigen-binding sites) and is thus
the largest of the antibody molecules. IgM is usually the first antibody
made during a primary response. Its 10 antigen-binding sites and large
shape allow it to bind well to many bacterial surfaces. It is excellent
at binding complement proteins and activating the complement cascade,
consistent with its role in promoting chemotaxis, opsonization, and cell
lysis. Thus, it is a very effective antibody against bacteria at early
stages of a primary antibody response. As the primary response proceeds,
the antibody produced in a B cell can change to IgG, IgA, or IgE by the
process known as class switching. <span data-type="term">Class
switching</span> is the change of one antibody class to another. While
the class of antibody changes, the specificity and the antigen-binding
sites do not. Thus, the antibodies made are still specific to the
pathogen that stimulated the initial IgM response.
{: #fs-id2522080}

<span data-type="term">IgG</span> is a major antibody of late primary
responses and the main antibody of secondary responses in the blood.
This is because class switching occurs during primary responses. IgG is
a monomeric antibody that clears pathogens from the blood and can
activate complement proteins (although not as well as IgM), taking
advantage of its antibacterial activities. Furthermore, this class of
antibody is the one that crosses the placenta to protect the developing
fetus from disease exits the blood to the interstitial fluid to fight
extracellular pathogens.
{: #fs-id1278918}

<span data-type="term">IgA</span> exists in two forms, a four-chain
monomer in the blood and an eight-chain structure, or dimer, in exocrine
gland secretions of the mucous membranes, including mucus, saliva, and
tears. Thus, dimeric IgA is the only antibody to leave the interior of
the body to protect body surfaces. IgA is also of importance to
newborns, because this antibody is present in mother’s breast milk
(colostrum), which serves to protect the infant from disease.
{: #fs-id1866202}

<span data-type="term">IgE</span> is usually associated with allergies
and anaphylaxis. It is present in the lowest concentration in the blood,
because its Fc region binds strongly to an IgE-specific Fc receptor on
the surfaces of mast cells. IgE makes mast cell degranulation very
specific, such that if a person is allergic to peanuts, there will be
peanut-specific IgE bound to his or her mast cells. In this person,
eating peanuts will cause the mast cells to degranulate, sometimes
causing severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, a severe,
systemic allergic response that can cause death.

## Clonal Selection of B Cells
{: data-type="title"}

Clonal selection and expansion work much the same way in B cells as in T
cells. Only B cells with appropriate antigen specificity are selected
for and expanded ([\[link\]](#fig-ch22_04_03){:
.autogenerated-content}). Eventually, the plasma cells secrete
antibodies with antigenic specificity identical to those that were on
the surfaces of the selected B cells. Notice in the figure that both
plasma cells and memory B cells are generated simultaneously.

## Primary versus Secondary B Cell Responses
{: data-type="title"}

Primary and secondary responses as they relate to T cells were discussed
earlier. This section will look at these responses with B cells and
antibody production. Because antibodies are easily obtained from blood
samples, they are easy to follow and graph
([\[link\]](#fig-ch22_04_04){: .autogenerated-content}). As you will see
from the figure, the primary response to an antigen (representing a
pathogen) is delayed by several days. This is the time it takes for the
B cell clones to expand and differentiate into plasma cells. The level
of antibody produced is low, but it is sufficient for immune protection.
The second time a person encounters the same antigen, there is no time
delay, and the amount of antibody made is much higher. Thus, the
secondary antibody response overwhelms the pathogens quickly and, in
most situations, no symptoms are felt. When a different antigen is used,
another primary response is made with its low antibody levels and time
delay.

# Active versus Passive Immunity
{: data-type="title"}

Immunity to pathogens, and the ability to control pathogen growth so
that damage to the tissues of the body is limited, can be acquired by
(1) the active development of an immune response in the infected
individual or (2) the passive transfer of immune components from an
immune individual to a nonimmune one. Both active and passive immunity
have examples in the natural world and as part of medicine.
{: #fs-id1390884}

<span data-type="term">Active immunity</span> is the resistance to
pathogens acquired during an adaptive immune response within an
individual ([\[link\]](#tbl-ch22_06){: .autogenerated-content}).
Naturally acquired active immunity, the response to a pathogen, is the
focus of this chapter. Artificially acquired active immunity involves
the use of vaccines. A vaccine is a killed or weakened pathogen or its
components that, when administered to a healthy individual, leads to the
development of immunological memory (a weakened primary immune response)
without causing much in the way of symptoms. Thus, with the use of
vaccines, one can avoid the damage from disease that results from the
first exposure to the pathogen, yet reap the benefits of protection from
immunological memory. The advent of vaccines was one of the major
medical advances of the twentieth century and led to the eradication of
smallpox and the control of many infectious diseases, including polio,
measles, and whooping cough.
{: #fs-id2326407}

<table id="tbl-ch22_06" summary=""><thead> <tr> <th colspan="3">Active versus Passive Immunity</th> </tr> <tr> <th /> <th>Natural</th> <th>Artificial</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td><strong data-effect="bold">Active</strong></td> <td>Adaptive immune response</td> <td>Vaccine response</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong data-effect="bold">Passive</strong></td> <td>Trans-placental antibodies/breastfeeding</td> <td>Immune globulin injections</td> </tr> </tbody></table>
<span data-type="term">Passive immunity</span> arises from the transfer
of antibodies to an individual without requiring them to mount their own
active immune response. Naturally acquired passive immunity is seen
during fetal development. IgG is transferred from the maternal
circulation to the fetus via the placenta, protecting the fetus from
infection and protecting the newborn for the first few months of its
life. As already stated, a newborn benefits from the IgA antibodies it
obtains from milk during breastfeeding. The fetus and newborn thus
benefit from the immunological memory of the mother to the pathogens to
which she has been exposed. In medicine, artificially acquired passive
immunity usually involves injections of immunoglobulins, taken from
animals previously exposed to a specific pathogen. This treatment is a
fast-acting method of temporarily protecting an individual who was
possibly exposed to a pathogen. The downside to both types of passive
immunity is the lack of the development of immunological memory. Once
the antibodies are transferred, they are effective for only a limited
time before they degrade.

# T cell-dependent versus T cell-independent Antigens
{: data-type="title"}

As discussed previously, Th2 cells secrete cytokines that drive the
production of antibodies in a B cell, responding to complex antigens
such as those made by proteins. On the other hand, some antigens are T
cell independent. A <span data-type="term">T cell-independent
antigen</span> usually is in the form of repeated carbohydrate moieties
found on the cell walls of bacteria. Each antibody on the B cell surface
has two binding sites, and the repeated nature of T cell-independent
antigen leads to crosslinking of the surface antibodies on the B cell.
The crosslinking is enough to activate it in the absence of T cell
cytokines.
{: #fs-id1493116}

A <span data-type="term">T cell-dependent antigen</span>, on the other
hand, usually is not repeated to the same degree on the pathogen and
thus does not crosslink surface antibody with the same efficiency. To
elicit a response to such antigens, the B and T cells must come close
together ([\[link\]](#fig-ch22_04_05){: .autogenerated-content}). The B
cell must receive two signals to become activated. Its surface
immunoglobulin must recognize native antigen. Some of this antigen is
internalized, processed, and presented to the Th2 cells on a class II
MHC molecule. The T cell then binds using its antigen receptor and is
activated to secrete cytokines that diffuse to the B cell, finally
activating it completely. Thus, the B cell receives signals from both
its surface antibody and the T cell via its cytokines, and acts as a
professional antigen-presenting cell in the process.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

B cells, which develop within the bone marrow, are responsible for
making five different classes of antibodies, each with its own
functions. B cells have their own mechanisms for tolerance, but in
peripheral tolerance, the B cells that leave the bone marrow remain
inactive due to T cell tolerance. Some B cells do not need T cell
cytokines to make antibody, and they bypass this need by the
crosslinking of their surface immunoglobulin by repeated carbohydrate
residues found in the cell walls of many bacterial species. Others
require T cells to become activated.
