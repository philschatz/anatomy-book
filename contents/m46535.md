The brain is a complex organ composed of gray parts and white matter,
which can be hard to distinguish. Starting from an embryologic
perspective allows you to understand more easily how the parts relate to
each other. The embryonic nervous system begins as a very simple
structure—essentially just a straight line, which then gets increasingly
complex. Looking at the development of the nervous system with a couple
of early snapshots makes it easier to understand the whole complex
system.
{: #fs-id2035280}

Many structures that appear to be adjacent in the adult brain are not
connected, and the connections that exist may seem arbitrary. But there
is an underlying order to the system that comes from how different parts
develop. By following the developmental pattern, it is possible to learn
what the major regions of the nervous system are.

# The Neural Tube
{: data-type="title"}

To begin, a sperm cell and an egg cell fuse to become a fertilized egg.
The fertilized egg cell, or zygote, starts dividing to generate the
cells that make up an entire organism. Sixteen days after fertilization,
the developing embryo’s cells belong to one of three germ layers that
give rise to the different tissues in the body. The endoderm, or inner
tissue, is responsible for generating the lining tissues of various
spaces within the body, such as the mucosae of the digestive and
respiratory systems. The mesoderm, or middle tissue, gives rise to most
of the muscle and connective tissues. Finally the ectoderm, or outer
tissue, develops into the integumentary system (the skin) and the
nervous system. It is probably not difficult to see that the outer
tissue of the embryo becomes the outer covering of the body. But how is
it responsible for the nervous system?
{: #fs-id2127657}

As the embryo develops, a portion of the ectoderm differentiates into a
specialized region of neuroectoderm, which is the precursor for the
tissue of the nervous system. Molecular signals induce cells in this
region to differentiate into the neuroepithelium, forming a <span
data-type="term">neural plate</span>. The cells then begin to change
shape, causing the tissue to buckle and fold inward
([\[link\]](#fig-ch13_01_01){: .autogenerated-content}). A <span
data-type="term">neural groove</span> forms, visible as a line along the
dorsal surface of the embryo. The ridge-like edge on either side of the
neural groove is referred as the <span data-type="term">neural
fold</span>. As the neural folds come together and converge, the
underlying structure forms into a tube just beneath the ectoderm called
the <span data-type="term">neural tube</span>. Cells from the neural
folds then separate from the ectoderm to form a cluster of cells
referred to as the <span data-type="term">neural crest</span>, which
runs lateral to the neural tube. The neural crest migrates away from the
nascent, or embryonic, central nervous system (CNS) that will form along
the neural groove and develops into several parts of the peripheral
nervous system (PNS), including the enteric nervous tissue. Many tissues
that are not part of the nervous system also arise from the neural
crest, such as craniofacial cartilage and bone, and melanocytes.

The neuroectoderm begins to fold inward to form the neural groove. As
the two sides of the neural groove converge, they form the neural tube,
which lies beneath the ectoderm. The anterior end of the neural tube
will develop into the brain, and the posterior portion will become the
spinal cord. The neural crest develops into peripheral structures.

At this point, the early nervous system is a simple, hollow tube. It
runs from the anterior end of the embryo to the posterior end. Beginning
at 25 days, the anterior end develops into the brain, and the posterior
portion becomes the spinal cord. This is the most basic arrangement of
tissue in the nervous system, and it gives rise to the more complex
structures by the fourth week of development.

# Primary Vesicles
{: data-type="title"}

As the anterior end of the neural tube starts to develop into the brain,
it undergoes a couple of enlargements; the result is the production of
sac-like vesicles. Similar to a child’s balloon animal, the long,
straight neural tube begins to take on a new shape. Three vesicles form
at the first stage, which are called <span data-type="term">primary
vesicles</span>. These vesicles are given names that are based on Greek
words, the main root word being *enkephalon*{: data-effect="italics"},
which means “brain” (en- = “inside”; kephalon = “head”). The prefix to
each generally corresponds to its position along the length of the
developing nervous system.
{: #fs-id2566835}

The <span data-type="term">prosencephalon</span> (pros- = “in front”) is
the forward-most vesicle, and the term can be loosely translated to mean
<span data-type="term">forebrain</span>. The <span
data-type="term">mesencephalon</span> (mes- = “middle”) is the next
vesicle, which can be called the <span data-type="term">midbrain</span>.
The third vesicle at this stage is the <span
data-type="term">rhombencephalon</span>. The first part of this word is
also the root of the word rhombus, which is a geometrical figure with
four sides of equal length (a square is a rhombus with 90° angles).
Whereas prosencephalon and mesencephalon translate into the English
words forebrain and midbrain, there is not a word for
“four-sided-figure-brain.” However, the third vesicle can be called the
<span data-type="term">hindbrain</span>. One way of thinking about how
the brain is arranged is to use these three regions—forebrain, midbrain,
and hindbrain—which are based on the primary vesicle stage of
development ([\[link\]](#fig-ch13_01_02){:
.autogenerated-content}**a**{: data-effect="bold"}).
{: #fs-id1640739}

</section>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2104336" markdown="1">
# Secondary Vesicles
{: data-type="title"}

The brain continues to develop, and the vesicles differentiate further
(see [\[link\]](#fig-ch13_01_02){: .autogenerated-content}**b**{:
data-effect="bold"}). The three primary vesicles become five <span
data-type="term">secondary vesicles</span>. The prosencephalon enlarges
into two new vesicles called the <span
data-type="term">telencephalon</span> and the <span
data-type="term">diencephalon</span>. The telecephalon will become the
cerebrum. The diencephalon gives rise to several adult structures; two
that will be important are the thalamus and the hypothalamus. In the
embryonic diencephalon, a structure known as the eye cup develops, which
will eventually become the retina, the nervous tissue of the eye called
the retina. This is a rare example of nervous tissue developing as part
of the CNS structures in the embryo, but becoming a peripheral structure
in the fully formed nervous system.
{: #fs-id1599097}

The mesencephalon does not differentiate into any finer divisions. The
midbrain is an established region of the brain at the primary vesicle
stage of development and remains that way. The rest of the brain
develops around it and constitutes a large percentage of the mass of the
brain. Dividing the brain into forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain is
useful in considering its developmental pattern, but the midbrain is a
small proportion of the entire brain, relatively speaking.
{: #fs-id2168764}

The rhombencephalon develops into the <span
data-type="term">metencephalon</span> and <span
data-type="term">myelencephalon</span>. The metencephalon corresponds to
the adult structure known as the pons and also gives rise to the
cerebellum. The cerebellum (from the Latin meaning “little brain”)
accounts for about 10 percent of the mass of the brain and is an
important structure in itself. The most significant connection between
the cerebellum and the rest of the brain is at the pons, because the
pons and cerebellum develop out of the same vesicle. The myelencephalon
corresponds to the adult structure known as the medulla oblongata. The
structures that come from the mesencephalon and rhombencephalon, except
for the cerebellum, are collectively considered the <span
data-type="term">brain stem</span>, which specifically includes the
midbrain, pons, and medulla.

Watch this [animation][1] to examine the development of the brain,
starting with the neural tube. As the anterior end of the neural tube
develops, it enlarges into the primary vesicles that establish the
forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. Those structures continue to develop
throughout the rest of embryonic development and into adolescence. They
are the basis of the structure of the fully developed adult brain. How
would you describe the difference in the relative sizes of the three
regions of the brain when comparing the early (25th embryonic day) brain
and the adult brain?

# Spinal Cord Development
{: data-type="title"}

While the brain is developing from the anterior neural tube, the spinal
cord is developing from the posterior neural tube. However, its
structure does not differ from the basic layout of the neural tube. It
is a long, straight cord with a small, hollow space down the center. The
neural tube is defined in terms of its anterior versus posterior
portions, but it also has a dorsal–ventral dimension. As the neural tube
separates from the rest of the ectoderm, the side closest to the surface
is dorsal, and the deeper side is ventral.
{: #fs-id1484442}

As the spinal cord develops, the cells making up the wall of the neural
tube proliferate and differentiate into the neurons and glia of the
spinal cord. The dorsal tissues will be associated with sensory
functions, and the ventral tissues will be associated with motor
functions.

# Relating Embryonic Development to the Adult Brain
{: data-type="title"}

Embryonic development can help in understanding the structure of the
adult brain because it establishes a framework on which more complex
structures can be built. First, the neural tube establishes the
anterior–posterior dimension of the nervous system, which is called the
<span data-type="term">neuraxis</span>. The embryonic nervous system in
mammals can be said to have a standard arrangement. Humans (and other
primates, to some degree) make this complicated by standing up and
walking on two legs. The anterior–posterior dimension of the neuraxis
overlays the superior–inferior dimension of the body. However, there is
a major curve between the brain stem and forebrain, which is called the
<span data-type="term">cephalic flexure</span>. Because of this, the
neuraxis starts in an inferior position—the end of the spinal cord—and
ends in an anterior position, the front of the cerebrum. If this is
confusing, just imagine a four-legged animal standing up on two legs.
Without the flexure in the brain stem, and at the top of the neck, that
animal would be looking straight up instead of straight in front
([\[link\]](#fig-ch13_01_03){: .autogenerated-content}).

along an anterior to posterior axis, from nose to tail for a four-legged
animal like a dog. Humans, as two-legged animals, have a bend in the

in the neck, so that the eyes and the face are oriented forward.

In summary, the primary vesicles help to establish the basic regions of
the nervous system: forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. These divisions
are useful in certain situations, but they are not equivalent regions.
The midbrain is small compared with the hindbrain and particularly the
forebrain. The secondary vesicles go on to establish the major regions
of the adult nervous system that will be followed in this text. The
telencephalon is the cerebrum, which is the major portion of the human
brain. The diencephalon continues to be referred to by this Greek name,
because there is no better term for it (dia- = “through”). The
diencephalon is between the cerebrum and the rest of the nervous system
and can be described as the region through which all projections have to
pass between the cerebrum and everything else. The brain stem includes
the midbrain, pons, and medulla, which correspond to the mesencephalon,
metencephalon, and myelencephalon. The cerebellum, being a large portion
of the brain, is considered a separate region.
[\[link\]](#tbl-ch13_01){: .autogenerated-content} connects the
different stages of development to the adult structures of the CNS.
{: #fs-id1088309}

One other benefit of considering embryonic development is that certain
connections are more obvious because of how these adult structures are
related. The retina, which began as part of the diencephalon, is
primarily connected to the diencephalon. The eyes are just inferior to
the anterior-most part of the cerebrum, but the optic nerve extends back
to the thalamus as the optic tract, with branches into a region of the
hypothalamus. There is also a connection of the optic tract to the
midbrain, but the mesencephalon is adjacent to the diencephalon, so that
is not difficult to imagine. The cerebellum originates out of the
metencephalon, and its largest white matter connection is to the pons,
also from the metencephalon. There are connections between the
cerebellum and both the medulla and midbrain, which are adjacent
structures in the secondary vesicle stage of development. In the adult
brain, the cerebellum seems close to the cerebrum, but there is no
direct connection between them.
{: #fs-id1497167}

Another aspect of the adult CNS structures that relates to embryonic
development is the ventricles—open spaces within the CNS where
cerebrospinal fluid circulates. They are the remnant of the hollow
center of the neural tube. The four ventricles and the tubular spaces
associated with them can be linked back to the hollow center of the
embryonic brain (see [\[link\]](#tbl-ch13_01){:
.autogenerated-content}).

Disorders of the…
</div>
<span data-type="title">Nervous System</span> Early formation of the
nervous system depends on the formation of the neural tube. A groove
forms along the dorsal surface of the embryo, which becomes deeper until
its edges meet and close off to form the tube. If this fails to happen,
especially in the posterior region where the spinal cord forms, a
developmental defect called spina bifida occurs. The closing of the
neural tube is important for more than just the proper formation of the
nervous system. The surrounding tissues are dependent on the correct
development of the tube. The connective tissues surrounding the CNS can
be involved as well.
{: #fs-id767897}

There are three classes of this disorder: occulta, meningocele, and
myelomeningocele ([\[link\]](#fig-ch13_01_04){:
.autogenerated-content}). The first type, spina bifida occulta, is the
mildest because the vertebral bones do not fully surround the spinal
cord, but the spinal cord itself is not affected. No functional
differences may be noticed, which is what the word occulta means; it is
hidden spina bifida. The other two types both involve the formation of a
cyst—a fluid-filled sac of the connective tissues that cover the spinal
cord called the meninges. “Meningocele” means that the meninges protrude
through the spinal column but nerves may not be involved and few
symptoms are present, though complications may arise later in life.
“Myelomeningocele” means that the meninges protrude and spinal nerves
are involved, and therefore severe neurological symptoms can be present.
{: #fs-id1836748}

Often surgery to close the opening or to remove the cyst is necessary.
The earlier that surgery can be performed, the better the chances of
controlling or limiting further damage or infection at the opening. For
many children with meningocele, surgery will alleviate the pain,
although they may experience some functional loss. Because the
myelomeningocele form of spina bifida involves more extensive damage to
the nervous tissue, neurological damage may persist, but symptoms can
often be handled. Complications of the spinal cord may present later in
life, but overall life expectancy is not reduced.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The development of the nervous system starts early in embryonic
development. The outer layer of the embryo, the ectoderm, gives rise to
the skin and the nervous system. A specialized region of this layer, the
neuroectoderm, becomes a groove that folds in and becomes the neural
tube beneath the dorsal surface of the embryo. The anterior end of the
neural tube develops into the brain, and the posterior region becomes
the spinal cord. Tissues at the edges of the neural groove, when it
closes off, are called the neural crest and migrate through the embryo
to give rise to PNS structures as well as some non-nervous tissues.
{: #fs-id1324069}

The brain develops from this early tube structure and gives rise to
specific regions of the adult brain. As the neural tube grows and
differentiates, it enlarges into three vesicles that correspond to the
forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain regions of the adult brain. Later in
development, two of these three vesicles differentiate further,
resulting in five vesicles. Those five vesicles can be aligned with the
four major regions of the adult brain. The cerebrum is formed directly
from the telencephalon. The diencephalon is the only region that keeps
its embryonic name. The mesencephalon, metencephalon, and myelencephalon
become the brain stem. The cerebellum also develops from the
metencephalon and is a separate region of the adult brain.
{: #fs-id1126733}

The spinal cord develops out of the rest of the neural tube and retains
the tube structure, with the nervous tissue thickening and the hollow
center becoming a very small central canal through the cord. The rest of
the hollow center of the neural tube corresponds to open spaces within
the brain called the ventricles, where cerebrospinal fluid is found.

Studying the embryonic development of the nervous system makes it easier
to understand the complexity of the adult nervous system. Give one
example of how development in the embryonic nervous system explains a
more complex structure in the adult nervous system.

The retina, a PNS structure in the adult, grows from the diencephalon in
the embryonic nervous system. The mature connections from the retina
through the optic nerve/tract are to the hypothalamus and thalamus of
the diencephalon, and to the midbrain, which developed directly adjacent
to the diencephalon as the mesencephalon in the embryo.
