It is a complex job to balance the body on two feet and walk upright.
The muscles of the vertebral column, thorax, and abdominal wall extend,
flex, and stabilize different parts of the body’s trunk. The deep
muscles of the core of the body help maintain posture as well as carry
out other functions. The brain sends out electrical impulses to these
various muscle groups to control posture by alternate contraction and
relaxation. This is necessary so that no single muscle group becomes
fatigued too quickly. If any one group fails to function, body posture
will be compromised.

# Muscles of the Abdomen

There are four pairs of abdominal muscles that cover the anterior and
lateral abdominal region and meet at the anterior midline. These muscles
of the anterolateral abdominal wall can be divided into four groups: the
external obliques, the internal obliques, the transversus abdominis, and
the rectus abdominis ([\[link\]](#fig-ch11_04_01){:
.autogenerated-content} and [\[link\]](#tbl-ch11_06){:
.autogenerated-content}).

![The top panel shows the lateral view of the superficial and deep abdominal muscles. The bottom panel shows the anterior view of the posterior abdominal muscles.](../resources/1112_Muscles_of_the_Abdomen.jpg "(a) The anterior abdominal muscles include the medially located rectus femoris, which is covered by a sheet of connective tissue called the linea alba. On the flanks of the body, medial to the rectus femoris, the abdominal wall is composed of three layers. The external oblique muscles form the outermost layer, while the internal oblique muscles form the middle layer, and the transverses abdominus forms the innermost layer. (b) The muscles of the lower back move the lumbar spine but also assist in femur movements."){: #fig-ch11_04_01 data-media-type="image/jpg" data-title="Muscles of the Abdomen "}

abdomen. The <span data-type="term">external oblique</span>, closest to
the surface, extend inferiorly and medially, in the direction of sliding
one’s four fingers into pants pockets. Perpendicular to it is the
intermediate <span data-type="term">internal oblique</span>, extending
superiorly and medially, the direction the thumbs usually go when the
other fingers are in the pants pocket. The deep muscle, the <span
data-type="term">transversus abdominis</span>, is arranged transversely
around the abdomen, similar to the front of a belt on a pair of pants.
This arrangement of three bands of muscles in different orientations
allows various movements and rotations of the trunk. The three layers of
muscle also help to protect the internal abdominal organs in an area
where there is no bone.

The <span data-type="term">linea alba</span> is a white, fibrous band
that is made of the bilateral <span data-type="term">rectus
sheaths</span> that join at the anterior midline of the body. These
enclose the <span data-type="term">rectus abdominis</span> muscles (a
pair of long, linear muscles, commonly called the “sit-up” muscles) that
originate at the pubic crest and symphysis, and extend the length of the
body’s trunk. Each muscle is segmented by three transverse bands of
collagen fibers called the <span data-type="term">tendinous
intersections</span>. This results in the look of “six-pack abs,” as
each segment hypertrophies on individuals at the gym who do many
sit-ups.

The posterior abdominal wall is formed by the lumbar vertebrae, parts of
the ilia of the hip bones, psoas major and iliacus muscles, and <span
data-type="term">quadratus lumborum</span> muscle. This part of the core
plays a key role in stabilizing the rest of the body and maintaining
posture.

</div>
<span data-type="title">Physical Therapists</span> Those who have a
muscle or joint injury will most likely be sent to a physical therapist
(PT) after seeing their regular doctor. PTs have a master’s degree or
doctorate, and are highly trained experts in the mechanics of body
movements. Many PTs also specialize in sports injuries.

If you injured your shoulder while you were kayaking, the first thing a
physical therapist would do during your first visit is to assess the
functionality of the joint. The range of motion of a particular joint
refers to the normal movements the joint performs. The PT will ask you
to abduct and adduct, circumduct, and flex and extend the arm. The PT
will note the shoulder’s degree of function, and based on the assessment
of the injury, will create an appropriate physical therapy plan.

The first step in physical therapy will probably be applying a heat pack
to the injured site, which acts much like a warm-up to draw blood to the
area, to enhance healing. You will be instructed to do a series of
exercises to continue the therapy at home, followed by icing, to
decrease inflammation and swelling, which will continue for several
weeks. When physical therapy is complete, the PT will do an exit exam
and send a detailed report on the improved range of motion and return of
normal limb function to your doctor. Gradually, as the injury heals, the
shoulder will begin to function correctly. A PT works closely with
patients to help them get back to their normal level of physical
activity.

# Muscles of the Thorax

The muscles of the chest serve to facilitate breathing by changing the
size of the thoracic cavity ([\[link\]](#tbl-ch11_07){:
.autogenerated-content}). When you inhale, your chest rises because the
cavity expands. Alternately, when you exhale, your chest falls because
the thoracic cavity decreases in size.

<table id="tbl-ch11_07" summary=""><thead> <tr> <th colspan="6">Muscles of the Thorax</th> </tr> <tr> <th>Movement</th> <th>Target</th> <th>Target motion direction</th> <th>Prime mover</th> <th>Origin</th> <th>Insertion</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td>Inhalation; exhalation</td> <td>Thoracic cavity</td> <td>Compression; expansion</td> <td>Diaphragm</td> <td>Sternum; ribs 6–12; lumbar vertebrae</td> <td>Central tendon</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Inhalation;exhalation</td> <td>Ribs</td> <td>Elevation (expands thoracic cavity)</td> <td>External intercostals</td> <td>Rib superior to each intercostal muscle</td> <td>Rib inferior to each intercostal muscle</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Forced exhalation</td> <td>Ribs</td> <td>Movement along superior/inferior axis to bring ribs closer together</td> <td>Internal intercostals</td> <td>Rib inferior to each intercostal muscle</td> <td>Rib superior to each intercostal muscle</td> </tr> </tbody></table>## The Diaphragm

The change in volume of the thoracic cavity during breathing is due to
the alternate contraction and relaxation of the <span
data-type="term">diaphragm</span> ([\[link\]](#fig-ch11_04_02){:
.autogenerated-content}). It separates the thoracic and abdominal
cavities, and is dome-shaped at rest. The superior surface of the
diaphragm is convex, creating the elevated floor of the thoracic cavity.
The inferior surface is concave, creating the curved roof of the
abdominal cavity.

![This figure shows the inferior view of the diaphragm with the major parts labeled.](../resources/1113_The_Diaphragm.jpg "The diaphragm separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities."){: #fig-ch11_04_02 data-media-type="image/jpg" data-title="Muscles of the Diaphragm "}

Defecating, urination, and even childbirth involve cooperation between
the diaphragm and abdominal muscles (this cooperation is referred to as
the “Valsalva maneuver”). You hold your breath by a steady contraction
of the diaphragm; this stabilizes the volume and pressure of the
peritoneal cavity. When the abdominal muscles contract, the pressure
cannot push the diaphragm up, so it increases pressure on the intestinal
tract (defecation), urinary tract (urination), or reproductive tract
(childbirth).

The inferior surface of the pericardial sac and the inferior surfaces of
the pleural membranes (parietal pleura) fuse onto the central tendon of
the diaphragm. To the sides of the tendon are the skeletal muscle
portions of the diaphragm, which insert into the tendon while having a
number of origins including the xiphoid process of the sternum
anteriorly, the inferior six ribs and their cartilages laterally, and
the lumbar vertebrae and 12th ribs posteriorly.

The diaphragm also includes three openings for the passage of structures
between the thorax and the abdomen. The inferior vena cava passes
through the <span data-type="term">caval opening</span>, and the
esophagus and attached nerves pass through the esophageal hiatus. The
aorta, thoracic duct, and azygous vein pass through the aortic hiatus of
the posterior diaphragm.

## The Intercostal Muscles

There are three sets of muscles, called <span
data-type="term">intercostal muscles</span>, which span each of the
intercostal spaces. The principal role of the intercostal muscles is to
assist in breathing by changing the dimensions of the rib cage
([\[link\]](#fig-ch11_04_03){: .autogenerated-content}).

![This figure shows the muscles in the thorax. The left panel shows the ribs, the major bones, and the muscles connecting them. The right panel shows a magnified view of the sternum and labels the muscles.](../resources/1114_Thorax.jpg "The external intercostals are located laterally on the sides of the body. The internal intercostals are located medially near the sternum. The innermost intercostals are located deep to both the internal and external intercostals."){: #fig-ch11_04_03 data-media-type="image/jpg" data-title="Intercostal Muscles "}

The 11 pairs of superficial <span data-type="term">external
intercostal</span> muscles aid in inspiration of air during breathing
because when they contract, they raise the rib cage, which expands it.
The 11 pairs of <span data-type="term">internal intercostal</span>
muscles, just under the externals, are used for expiration because they
draw the ribs together to constrict the rib cage. The <span
data-type="term">innermost intercostal</span> muscles are the deepest,
and they act as synergists for the action of the internal intercostals.

# Muscles of the Pelvic Floor and Perineum

The pelvic floor is a muscular sheet that defines the inferior portion
of the pelvic cavity. The <span data-type="term">pelvic
diaphragm</span>, spanning anteriorly to posteriorly from the pubis to
the coccyx, comprises the levator ani and the ischiococcygeus. Its
openings include the anal canal and urethra, and the vagina in women.

The large <span data-type="term">levator ani</span> consists of two
skeletal muscles, the <span data-type="term">pubococcygeus</span> and
the <span data-type="term">iliococcygeus</span>
([\[link\]](#fig-ch11_04_04){: .autogenerated-content}). The levator ani
is considered the most important muscle of the pelvic floor because it
supports the pelvic viscera. It resists the pressure produced by
contraction of the abdominal muscles so that the pressure is applied to
the colon to aid in defecation and to the uterus to aid in childbirth
(assisted by the <span data-type="term">ischiococcygeus</span>, which
pulls the coccyx anteriorly). This muscle also creates skeletal muscle
sphincters at the urethra and anus.

![This image shows the superior view of the pelvic diaphragm.](../resources/1115_Muscles_of_the_Pelvic_Floor.jpg "The pelvic floor muscles support the pelvic organs, resist intra-abdominal pressure, and work as sphincters for the urethra, rectum, and vagina."){: #fig-ch11_04_04 data-media-type="image/jpg" data-title="Muscles of the Pelvic Floor "}

The <span data-type="term">perineum</span> is the diamond-shaped space
between the pubic symphysis (anteriorly), the coccyx (posteriorly), and
the ischial tuberosities (laterally), lying just inferior to the pelvic
diaphragm (levator ani and coccygeus). Divided transversely into
triangles, the anterior is the <span data-type="term">urogenital
triangle</span>, which includes the external genitals. The posterior is
the <span data-type="term">anal triangle</span>, which contains the anus
([\[link\]](#fig-ch11_04_05){: .autogenerated-content}). The perineum is
also divided into superficial and deep layers with some of the muscles
common to men and women ([\[link\]](#fig-ch11_04_06){:
.autogenerated-content}). Women also have the <span
data-type="term">compressor urethrae</span> and the <span
data-type="term">sphincter urethrovaginalis</span>, which function to
close the vagina. In men, there is the <span data-type="term">deep
transverse perineal</span> muscle that plays a role in ejaculation.

![The left panel shows the muscles of the perineum in the male, and the right panel shows the muscles of the perineum in the female.](../resources/1116_Muscle_of_the_Perineum.jpg "The perineum muscles play roles in urination in both sexes, ejaculation in men, and vaginal contraction in women."){: #fig-ch11_04_05 data-media-type="image/jpg" data-title="Muscles of the Perineum "}

![This table describes the muscles of the perineum that are common to men and women. The levator ani pubococcygeus and levator ani iliococcygeus control movements during defaction, urination, coughing, and giving birth. They originate in the pubis and ischium. The superficial transverse perineal supports the perineal body maintaining the anus at the center of the perineum. It originates in the ischium. The bulbospongiosus is a superficial muscle that causes an involuntary response that compresses the urethra when excreting urine in both sexes or while ejaculating in males; it also aids in erection of the penis in males. It originates in the perineal body. The ischiocavernosus is a superficial muscle that compresses veins to maintain erection of the penis in males and erection of the clitoris in females. It originates in the ischium, ischial rami, and pubic rami. The external uretral sphincter is a deep muscle that voluntarily compresses the urethra during urination. It originates in the ischial rami and pubic rami. The external anal sphincter is a deep muscle that closes the anus. It originates in the anoccoccygeal ligament.](../resources/1128_Muscles_of_the_Perineum_Common_to_Men_and_Women.jpg){: #fig-ch11_04_06 data-media-type="image/jpg" data-title="Muscles of the Perineum Common to Men and Women "}

# Chapter Review

Made of skin, fascia, and four pairs of muscle, the anterior abdominal
wall protects the organs located in the abdomen and moves the vertebral
column. These muscles include the rectus abdominis, which extends
through the entire length of the trunk, the external oblique, the
internal oblique, and the transversus abdominus. The quadratus lumborum
forms the posterior abdominal wall.

The muscles of the thorax play a large role in breathing, especially the
dome-shaped diaphragm. When it contracts and flattens, the volume inside
the pleural cavities increases, which decreases the pressure within
them. As a result, air will flow into the lungs. The external and
internal intercostal muscles span the space between the ribs and help
change the shape of the rib cage and the volume-pressure ratio inside
the pleural cavities during inspiration and expiration.

The perineum muscles play roles in urination in both sexes, ejaculation
in men, and vaginal contraction in women. The pelvic floor muscles
support the pelvic organs, resist intra-abdominal pressure, and work as
sphincters for the urethra, rectum, and vagina.
