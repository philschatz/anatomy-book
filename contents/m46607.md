By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Describe the functional grouping of cranial nerves
* Match the regions of the forebrain and brain stem that are connected
  to each cranial nerve
* Suggest diagnoses that would explain certain losses of function in the
  cranial nerves
* Relate cranial nerve deficits to damage of adjacent, unrelated
  structures

The twelve cranial nerves are typically covered in introductory anatomy
courses, and memorizing their names is facilitated by numerous mnemonics
developed by students over the years of this practice. But knowing the
names of the nerves in order often leaves much to be desired in
understanding what the nerves do. The nerves can be categorized by
functions, and subtests of the cranial nerve exam can clarify these
functional groupings.
{: #fs-id2032544}

Three of the nerves are strictly responsible for special senses whereas
four others contain fibers for special and general senses. Three nerves
are connected to the extraocular muscles resulting in the control of
gaze. Four nerves connect to muscles of the face, oral cavity, and
pharynx, controlling facial expressions, mastication, swallowing, and
speech. Four nerves make up the cranial component of the parasympathetic
nervous system responsible for pupillary constriction, salivation, and
the regulation of the organs of the thoracic and upper abdominal
cavities. Finally, one nerve controls the muscles of the neck, assisting
with spinal control of the movement of the head and neck.
{: #fs-id1700815}

The cranial nerve exam allows directed tests of forebrain and brain stem
structures. The twelve cranial nerves serve the head and neck. The vagus
nerve (cranial nerve X) has autonomic functions in the thoracic and
superior abdominal cavities. The special senses are served through the
cranial nerves, as well as the general senses of the head and neck. The
movement of the eyes, face, tongue, throat, and neck are all under the
control of cranial nerves. Preganglionic parasympathetic nerve fibers
that control pupillary size, salivary glands, and the thoracic and upper
abdominal viscera are found in four of the nerves. Tests of these
functions can provide insight into damage to specific regions of the
brain stem and may uncover deficits in adjacent regions.

# Sensory Nerves
{: data-type="title"}

The olfactory, optic, and vestibulocochlear nerves (cranial nerves I,
II, and VIII) are dedicated to four of the special senses: smell,
vision, equilibrium, and hearing, respectively. Taste sensation is
relayed to the brain stem through fibers of the facial and
glossopharyngeal nerves. The trigeminal nerve is a mixed nerve that
carries the general somatic senses from the head, similar to those
coming through spinal nerves from the rest of the body.
{: #fs-id1540714}

Testing smell is straightforward, as common smells are presented to one
nostril at a time. The patient should be able to recognize the smell of
coffee or mint, indicating the proper functioning of the olfactory
system. Loss of the sense of smell is called anosmia and can be lost
following blunt trauma to the head or through aging. The short axons of
the first cranial nerve regenerate on a regular basis. The neurons in
the olfactory epithelium have a limited life span, and new cells grow to
replace the ones that die off. The axons from these neurons grow back
into the CNS by following the existing axons—representing one of the few
examples of such growth in the mature nervous system. If all of the
fibers are sheared when the brain moves within the cranium, such as in a
motor vehicle accident, then no axons can find their way back to the
olfactory bulb to re-establish connections. If the nerve is not
completely severed, the anosmia may be temporary as new neurons can
eventually reconnect.
{: #fs-id1978067}

Olfaction is not the pre-eminent sense, but its loss can be quite
detrimental. The enjoyment of food is largely based on our sense of
smell. Anosmia means that food will not seem to have the same taste,
though the gustatory sense is intact, and food will often be described
as being bland. However, the taste of food can be improved by adding
ingredients (e.g., salt) that stimulate the gustatory sense.
{: #fs-id2102052}

Testing vision relies on the tests that are common in an optometry
office. The <span data-type="term">Snellen chart</span>
([\[link\]](#fig-ch16_03_01){: .autogenerated-content}) demonstrates
visual acuity by presenting standard Roman letters in a variety of
sizes. The result of this test is a rough generalization of the acuity
of a person based on the normal accepted acuity, such that a letter that
subtends a visual angle of 5 minutes of an arc at 20 feet can be seen.
To have 20/60 vision, for example, means that the smallest letters that
a person can see at a 20-foot distance could be seen by a person with
normal acuity from 60 feet away. Testing the extent of the visual field
means that the examiner can establish the boundaries of peripheral
vision as simply as holding their hands out to either side and asking
the patient when the fingers are no longer visible without moving the
eyes to track them. If it is necessary, further tests can establish the
perceptions in the visual fields. Physical inspection of the optic disk,
or where the optic nerve emerges from the eye, can be accomplished by
looking through the pupil with an ophthalmoscope.

The Snellen Chart
</div>
<figcaption>
The Snellen chart for visual acuity presents a limited number of Roman
letters in lines of decreasing size. The line with letters that subtend
5 minutes of an arc from 20 feet represents the smallest letters that a
person with normal acuity should be able to read at that distance. The
different sizes of letters in the other lines represent rough
approximations of what a person of normal acuity can read at different
distances. For example, the line that represents 20/200 vision would
have larger letters so that they are legible to the person with normal
acuity at 200 feet.

The optic nerves from both sides enter the cranium through the
respective optic canals and meet at the optic chiasm at which fibers
sort such that the two halves of the visual field are processed by the
opposite sides of the brain. Deficits in visual field perception often
suggest damage along the length of the optic pathway between the orbit
and the diencephalon. For example, loss of peripheral vision may be the
result of a pituitary tumor pressing on the optic chiasm
([\[link\]](#fig-ch16_03_02){: .autogenerated-content}). The pituitary,
seated in the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone, is directly inferior
to the optic chiasm. The axons that decussate in the chiasm are from the
medial retinae of either eye, and therefore carry information from the
peripheral visual field.
{: #fs-id2072040}

Pituitary Tumor
</div>
<figcaption>
The pituitary gland is located in the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone
within the cranial floor, placing it immediately inferior to the optic
chiasm. If the pituitary gland develops a tumor, it can press against
the fibers crossing in the chiasm. Those fibers are conveying peripheral
visual information to the opposite side of the brain, so the patient
will experience “tunnel vision”—meaning that only the central visual
field will be perceived.

The vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) carries both equilibrium and
auditory sensations from the inner ear to the medulla. Though the two
senses are not directly related, anatomy is mirrored in the two systems.
Problems with balance, such as vertigo, and deficits in hearing may both
point to problems with the inner ear. Within the petrous region of the
temporal bone is the bony labyrinth of the inner ear. The vestibule is
the portion for equilibrium, composed of the utricle, saccule, and the
three semicircular canals. The cochlea is responsible for transducing
sound waves into a neural signal. The sensory nerves from these two
structures travel side-by-side as the vestibulocochlear nerve, though
they are really separate divisions. They both emerge from the inner ear,
pass through the internal auditory meatus, and synapse in nuclei of the
superior medulla. Though they are part of distinct sensory systems, the
vestibular nuclei and the cochlear nuclei are close neighbors with
adjacent inputs. Deficits in one or both systems could occur from damage
that encompasses structures close to both. Damage to structures near the
two nuclei can result in deficits to one or both systems.
{: #fs-id1226920}

Balance or hearing deficits may be the result of damage to the middle or
inner ear structures. Ménière\'s disease is a disorder that can affect
both equilibrium and audition in a variety of ways. The patient can
suffer from vertigo, a low-frequency ringing in the ears, or a loss of
hearing. From patient to patient, the exact presentation of the disease
can be different. Additionally, within a single patient, the symptoms
and signs may change as the disease progresses. Use of the neurological
exam subtests for the vestibulocochlear nerve illuminates the changes a
patient may go through. The disease appears to be the result of
accumulation, or over-production, of fluid in the inner ear, in either
the vestibule or cochlea.
{: #fs-id2157619}

Tests of equilibrium are important for coordination and gait and are
related to other aspects of the neurological exam. The vestibulo-ocular
reflex involves the cranial nerves for gaze control. Balance and
equilibrium, as tested by the Romberg test, are part of spinal and
cerebellar processes and involved in those components of the
neurological exam, as discussed later.
{: #fs-id1520520}

Hearing is tested by using a tuning fork in a couple of different ways.
The <span data-type="term">Rinne test</span> involves using a tuning
fork to distinguish between <span data-type="term">conductive
hearing</span> and <span data-type="term">sensorineural hearing</span>.
Conductive hearing relies on vibrations being conducted through the
ossicles of the middle ear. Sensorineural hearing is the transmission of
sound stimuli through the neural components of the inner ear and cranial
nerve. A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the mastoid process and the
patient indicates when the sound produced from this is no longer
present. Then the fork is immediately moved to just next to the ear
canal so the sound travels through the air. If the sound is not heard
through the ear, meaning the sound is conducted better through the
temporal bone than through the ossicles, a conductive hearing deficit is
present. The <span data-type="term">Weber test</span> also uses a tuning
fork to differentiate between conductive versus sensorineural hearing
loss. In this test, the tuning fork is placed at the top of the skull,
and the sound of the tuning fork reaches both inner ears by travelling
through bone. In a healthy patient, the sound would appear equally loud
in both ears. With unilateral conductive hearing loss, however, the
tuning fork sounds louder in the ear with hearing loss. This is because
the sound of the tuning fork has to compete with background noise coming
from the outer ear, but in conductive hearing loss, the background noise
is blocked in the damaged ear, allowing the tuning fork to sound
relatively louder in that ear. With unilateral sensorineural hearing
loss, however, damage to the cochlea or associated nervous tissue means
that the tuning fork sounds quieter in that ear.
{: #fs-id1962641}

The trigeminal system of the head and neck is the equivalent of the
ascending spinal cord systems of the dorsal column and the spinothalamic
pathways. Somatosensation of the face is conveyed along the nerve to
enter the brain stem at the level of the pons. Synapses of those axons,
however, are distributed across nuclei found throughout the brain stem.
The mesencephalic nucleus processes proprioceptive information of the
face, which is the movement and position of facial muscles. It is the
sensory component of the <span data-type="term">jaw-jerk reflex</span>,
a stretch reflex of the masseter muscle. The chief nucleus, located in
the pons, receives information about light touch as well as
proprioceptive information about the mandible, which are both relayed to
the thalamus and, ultimately, to the postcentral gyrus of the parietal
lobe. The spinal trigeminal nucleus, located in the medulla, receives
information about crude touch, pain, and temperature to be relayed to
the thalamus and cortex. Essentially, the projection through the chief
nucleus is analogous to the dorsal column pathway for the body, and the
projection through the spinal trigeminal nucleus is analogous to the
spinothalamic pathway.
{: #fs-id2427159}

Subtests for the sensory component of the trigeminal system are the same
as those for the sensory exam targeting the spinal nerves. The primary
sensory subtest for the trigeminal system is sensory discrimination. A
cotton-tipped applicator, which is cotton attached to the end of a thin
wooden stick, can be used easily for this. The wood of the applicator
can be snapped so that a pointed end is opposite the soft cotton-tipped
end. The cotton end provides a touch stimulus, while the pointed end
provides a painful, or sharp, stimulus. While the patient’s eyes are
closed, the examiner touches the two ends of the applicator to the
patient’s face, alternating randomly between them. The patient must
identify whether the stimulus is sharp or dull. These stimuli are
processed by the trigeminal system separately. Contact with the cotton
tip of the applicator is a light touch, relayed by the chief nucleus,
but contact with the pointed end of the applicator is a painful stimulus
relayed by the spinal trigeminal nucleus. Failure to discriminate these
stimuli can localize problems within the brain stem. If a patient cannot
recognize a painful stimulus, that might indicate damage to the spinal
trigeminal nucleus in the medulla. The medulla also contains important
regions that regulate the cardiovascular, respiratory, and digestive
systems, as well as being the pathway for ascending and descending
tracts between the brain and spinal cord. Damage, such as a stroke, that
results in changes in sensory discrimination may indicate these
unrelated regions are affected as well.

# Gaze Control
{: data-type="title"}

The three nerves that control the extraocular muscles are the
oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves, which are the third, fourth,
and sixth cranial nerves. As the name suggests, the abducens nerve is
responsible for abducting the eye, which it controls through contraction
of the lateral rectus muscle. The trochlear nerve controls the superior
oblique muscle to rotate the eye along its axis in the orbit medially,
which is called <span data-type="term">intorsion</span>, and is a
component of focusing the eyes on an object close to the face. The
oculomotor nerve controls all the other extraocular muscles, as well as
a muscle of the upper eyelid. Movements of the two eyes need to be
coordinated to locate and track visual stimuli accurately. When moving
the eyes to locate an object in the horizontal plane, or to track
movement horizontally in the visual field, the lateral rectus muscle of
one eye and medial rectus muscle of the other eye are both active. The
lateral rectus is controlled by neurons of the abducens nucleus in the
superior medulla, whereas the medial rectus is controlled by neurons in
the oculomotor nucleus of the midbrain.
{: #fs-id2337668}

Coordinated movement of both eyes through different nuclei requires
integrated processing through the brain stem. In the midbrain, the
superior colliculus integrates visual stimuli with motor responses to
initiate eye movements. The <span data-type="term">paramedian pontine
reticular formation (PPRF)</span> will initiate a rapid eye movement, or
<span data-type="term">saccade</span>, to bring the eyes to bear on a
visual stimulus quickly. These areas are connected to the oculomotor,
trochlear, and abducens nuclei by the <span data-type="term">medial
longitudinal fasciculus (MLF)</span> that runs through the majority of
the brain stem. The MLF allows for <span data-type="term">conjugate
gaze</span>, or the movement of the eyes in the same direction, during
horizontal movements that require the lateral and medial rectus muscles.
Control of conjugate gaze strictly in the vertical direction is
contained within the oculomotor complex. To elevate the eyes, the
oculomotor nerve on either side stimulates the contraction of both
superior rectus muscles; to depress the eyes, the oculomotor nerve on
either side stimulates the contraction of both inferior rectus muscles.
{: #fs-id2364152}

Purely vertical movements of the eyes are not very common. Movements are
often at an angle, so some horizontal components are necessary, adding
the medial and lateral rectus muscles to the movement. The rapid
movement of the eyes used to locate and direct the fovea onto visual
stimuli is called a saccade. Notice that the paths that are traced in
[\[link\]](#fig-ch16_03_03){: .autogenerated-content} are not strictly
vertical. The movements between the nose and the mouth are closest, but
still have a slant to them. Also, the superior and inferior rectus
muscles are not perfectly oriented with the line of sight. The origin
for both muscles is medial to their insertions, so elevation and
depression may require the lateral rectus muscles to compensate for the
slight adduction inherent in the contraction of those muscles, requiring
MLF activity as well.

Testing eye movement is simply a matter of having the patient track the
tip of a pen as it is passed through the visual field. This may appear
similar to testing visual field deficits related to the optic nerve, but
the difference is that the patient is asked to not move the eyes while
the examiner moves a stimulus into the peripheral visual field. Here,
the extent of movement is the point of the test. The examiner is
watching for conjugate movements representing proper function of the
related nuclei and the MLF. Failure of one eye to abduct while the other
adducts in a horizontal movement is referred to as <span
data-type="term">internuclear ophthalmoplegia</span>. When this occurs,
the patient will experience <span data-type="term">diplopia</span>, or
double vision, as the two eyes are temporarily pointed at different
stimuli. Diplopia is not restricted to failure of the lateral rectus,
because any of the extraocular muscles may fail to move one eye in
perfect conjugation with the other.
{: #fs-id1475678}

The final aspect of testing eye movements is to move the tip of the pen
in toward the patient’s face. As visual stimuli move closer to the face,
the two medial recti muscles cause the eyes to move in the one
nonconjugate movement that is part of gaze control. When the two eyes
move to look at something closer to the face, they both adduct, which is
referred to as <span data-type="term">convergence</span>. To keep the
stimulus in focus, the eye also needs to change the shape of the lens,
which is controlled through the parasympathetic fibers of the oculomotor
nerve. The change in focal power of the eye is referred to as <span
data-type="term">accommodation</span>. Accommodation ability changes
with age; focusing on nearer objects, such as the written text of a book
or on a computer screen, may require corrective lenses later in life.
Coordination of the skeletal muscles for convergence and coordination of
the smooth muscles of the ciliary body for accommodation are referred to
as the <span data-type="term">accommodation–convergence reflex</span>.
{: #fs-id2070652}

A crucial function of the cranial nerves is to keep visual stimuli
centered on the fovea of the retina. The <span
data-type="term">vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)</span> coordinates all of
the components ([\[link\]](#fig-ch16_03_04){: .autogenerated-content}),
both sensory and motor, that make this possible. If the head rotates in
one direction—for example, to the right—the horizontal pair of
semicircular canals in the inner ear indicate the movement by increased
activity on the right and decreased activity on the left. The
information is sent to the abducens nuclei and oculomotor nuclei on
either side to coordinate the lateral and medial rectus muscles. The
left lateral rectus and right medial rectus muscles will contract,
rotating the eyes in the opposite direction of the head, while nuclei
controlling the right lateral rectus and left medial rectus muscles will
be inhibited to reduce antagonism of the contracting muscles. These
actions stabilize the visual field by compensating for the head rotation
with opposite rotation of the eyes in the orbits. Deficits in the VOR
may be related to vestibular damage, such as in Ménière’s disease, or
from dorsal brain stem damage that would affect the eye movement nuclei
or their connections through the MLF.

# Nerves of the Face and Oral Cavity
{: data-type="title"}

An iconic part of a doctor’s visit is the inspection of the oral cavity
and pharynx, suggested by the directive to “open your mouth and say
‘ah.’” This is followed by inspection, with the aid of a tongue
depressor, of the back of the mouth, or the opening of the oral cavity
into the pharynx known as the <span data-type="term">fauces</span>.
Whereas this portion of a medical exam inspects for signs of infection,
such as in tonsillitis, it is also the means to test the functions of
the cranial nerves that are associated with the oral cavity.
{: #fs-id2307861}

The facial and glossopharyngeal nerves convey gustatory stimulation to
the brain. Testing this is as simple as introducing salty, sour, bitter,
or sweet stimuli to either side of the tongue. The patient should
respond to the taste stimulus before retracting the tongue into the
mouth. Stimuli applied to specific locations on the tongue will dissolve
into the saliva and may stimulate taste buds connected to either the
left or right of the nerves, masking any lateral deficits. Along with
taste, the glossopharyngeal nerve relays general sensations from the
pharyngeal walls. These sensations, along with certain taste stimuli,
can stimulate the gag reflex. If the examiner moves the tongue depressor
to contact the lateral wall of the fauces, this should elicit the gag
reflex. Stimulation of either side of the fauces should elicit an
equivalent response. The motor response, through contraction of the
muscles of the pharynx, is mediated through the vagus nerve. Normally,
the vagus nerve is considered autonomic in nature. The vagus nerve
directly stimulates the contraction of skeletal muscles in the pharynx
and larynx to contribute to the swallowing and speech functions. Further
testing of vagus motor function has the patient repeating consonant
sounds that require movement of the muscles around the fauces. The
patient is asked to say “lah-kah-pah” or a similar set of alternating
sounds while the examiner observes the movements of the soft palate and
arches between the palate and tongue.
{: #fs-id2302120}

The facial and glossopharyngeal nerves are also responsible for the
initiation of salivation. Neurons in the salivary nuclei of the medulla
project through these two nerves as preganglionic fibers, and synapse in
ganglia located in the head. The parasympathetic fibers of the facial
nerve synapse in the pterygopalatine ganglion, which projects to the
submandibular gland and sublingual gland. The parasympathetic fibers of
the glossopharyngeal nerve synapse in the otic ganglion, which projects
to the parotid gland. Salivation in response to food in the oral cavity
is based on a visceral reflex arc within the facial or glossopharyngeal
nerves. Other stimuli that stimulate salivation are coordinated through
the hypothalamus, such as the smell and sight of food.
{: #fs-id1698585}

The hypoglossal nerve is the motor nerve that controls the muscles of
the tongue, except for the palatoglossus muscle, which is controlled by
the vagus nerve. There are two sets of muscles of the tongue. The <span
data-type="term">extrinsic muscles of the tongue</span> are connected to
other structures, whereas the <span data-type="term">intrinsic muscles
of the tongue</span> are completely contained within the lingual
tissues. While examining the oral cavity, movement of the tongue will
indicate whether hypoglossal function is impaired. The test for
hypoglossal function is the “stick out your tongue” part of the exam.
The genioglossus muscle is responsible for protrusion of the tongue. If
the hypoglossal nerves on both sides are working properly, then the
tongue will stick straight out. If the nerve on one side has a deficit,
the tongue will stick out to that side—pointing to the side with damage.
Loss of function of the tongue can interfere with speech and swallowing.
Additionally, because the location of the hypoglossal nerve and nucleus
is near the cardiovascular center, inspiratory and expiratory areas for
respiration, and the vagus nuclei that regulate digestive functions, a
tongue that protrudes incorrectly can suggest damage in adjacent
structures that have nothing to do with controlling the tongue.

Watch this short [video][1] to see an examination of the facial nerve
using some simple tests. The facial nerve controls the muscles of facial
expression. Severe deficits will be obvious in watching someone use
those muscles for normal control. One side of the face might not move
like the other side. But directed tests, especially for contraction
against resistance, require a formal testing of the muscles. The muscles
of the upper and lower face need to be tested. The strength test in this

# Motor Nerves of the Neck
{: data-type="title"}

The accessory nerve, also referred to as the spinal accessory nerve,
innervates the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles
([\[link\]](#fig-ch16_03_05){: .autogenerated-content}). When both the
sternocleidomastoids contract, the head flexes forward; individually,
they cause rotation to the opposite side. The trapezius can act as an
antagonist, causing extension and hyperextension of the neck. These two
superficial muscles are important for changing the position of the head.
Both muscles also receive input from cervical spinal nerves. Along with
the spinal accessory nerve, these nerves contribute to elevating the
scapula and clavicle through the trapezius, which is tested by asking
the patient to shrug both shoulders, and watching for asymmetry. For the
sternocleidomastoid, those spinal nerves are primarily sensory
projections, whereas the trapezius also has lateral insertions to the
clavicle and scapula, and receives motor input from the spinal cord.
Calling the nerve the spinal accessory nerve suggests that it is aiding
the spinal nerves. Though that is not precisely how the name originated,
it does help make the association between the function of this nerve in
controlling these muscles and the role these muscles play in movements
of the trunk or shoulders.

muscles, both of which attach to the head and to the trunk and

To test these muscles, the patient is asked to flex and extend the neck
or shrug the shoulders against resistance, testing the strength of the
muscles. Lateral flexion of the neck toward the shoulder tests both at
the same time. Any difference on one side versus the other would suggest
damage on the weaker side. These strength tests are common for the
skeletal muscles controlled by spinal nerves and are a significant
component of the motor exam. Deficits associated with the accessory

<span data-type="title">The Pupillary Light Response</span> The
autonomic control of pupillary size in response to a bright light
involves the sensory input of the optic nerve and the parasympathetic
motor output of the oculomotor nerve. When light hits the retina,
specialized photosensitive ganglion cells send a signal along the optic
nerve to the pretectal nucleus in the superior midbrain. A neuron from
this nucleus projects to the Eddinger–Westphal nuclei in the oculomotor
complex in both sides of the midbrain. Neurons in this nucleus give rise
to the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers that project through the
oculomotor nerve to the ciliary ganglion in the posterior orbit. The
postganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the ganglion project to the
iris, where they release acetylcholine onto circular fibers that
constrict the pupil to reduce the amount of light hitting the retina.
The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for dilating the pupil
when light levels are low.
{: #fs-id1582811}

Shining light in one eye will elicit constriction of both pupils. The
efferent limb of the pupillary light reflex is bilateral. Light shined
in one eye causes a constriction of that pupil, as well as constriction
of the contralateral pupil. Shining a penlight in the eye of a patient
is a very artificial situation, as both eyes are normally exposed to the
same light sources. Testing this reflex can illustrate whether the optic
nerve or the oculomotor nerve is damaged. If shining the light in one
eye results in no changes in pupillary size but shining light in the
opposite eye elicits a normal, bilateral response, the damage is
associated with the optic nerve on the nonresponsive side. If light in
either eye elicits a response in only one eye, the problem is with the
oculomotor system.
{: #fs-id1326606}

If light in the right eye only causes the left pupil to constrict, the
direct reflex is lost and the consensual reflex is intact, which means
that the right oculomotor nerve (or Eddinger–Westphal nucleus) is
damaged. Damage to the right oculomotor connections will be evident when
light is shined in the left eye. In that case, the direct reflex is
intact but the consensual reflex is lost, meaning that the left pupil
will constrict while the right does not.

# The Cranial Nerve Exam
{: data-type="title"}

The cranial nerves can be separated into four major groups associated
with the subtests of the cranial nerve exam. First are the sensory
nerves, then the nerves that control eye movement, the nerves of the
oral cavity and superior pharynx, and the nerve that controls movements
of the neck.
{: #fs-id2071389}

The olfactory, optic, and vestibulocochlear nerves are strictly sensory
nerves for smell, sight, and balance and hearing, whereas the
trigeminal, facial, and glossopharyngeal nerves carry somatosensation of
the face, and taste—separated between the anterior two-thirds of the
tongue and the posterior one-third. Special senses are tested by
presenting the particular stimuli to each receptive organ. General
senses can be tested through sensory discrimination of touch versus
painful stimuli.
{: #fs-id2499768}

The oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves control the extraocular
muscles and are connected by the medial longitudinal fasciculus to
coordinate gaze. Testing conjugate gaze is as simple as having the
patient follow a visual target, like a pen tip, through the visual field
ending with an approach toward the face to test convergence and
accommodation. Along with the vestibular functions of the eighth nerve,
the vestibulo-ocular reflex stabilizes gaze during head movements by
coordinating equilibrium sensations with the eye movement systems.
{: #fs-id1956663}

The trigeminal nerve controls the muscles of chewing, which are tested
for stretch reflexes. Motor functions of the facial nerve are usually
obvious if facial expressions are compromised, but can be tested by
having the patient raise their eyebrows, smile, and frown. Movements of
the tongue, soft palate, or superior pharynx can be observed directly
while the patient swallows, while the gag reflex is elicited, or while
the patient says repetitive consonant sounds. The motor control of the
gag reflex is largely controlled by fibers in the vagus nerve and
constitutes a test of that nerve because the parasympathetic functions
of that nerve are involved in visceral regulation, such as regulating
the heartbeat and digestion.
{: #fs-id1610997}

Movement of the head and neck using the sternocleidomastoid and
trapezius muscles is controlled by the accessory nerve. Flexing of the
neck and strength testing of those muscles reviews the function of that
nerve.

Watch this short [video][1] to see an examination of the facial nerve
using some simple tests. The facial nerve controls the muscles of facial
expression. Severe deficits will be obvious in watching someone use
those muscles for normal control. One side of the face might not move
like the other side. But directed tests, especially for contraction
against resistance, require a formal testing of the muscles. The muscles
of the upper and lower face need to be tested. The strength test in this
video involves the patient squeezing her eyes shut and the examiner
trying to pry her eyes open. Why does the examiner ask her to try a
second time?

She has just demonstrated voluntary control by closing her eyes, but
when he provides the resistance that she needs to hold tight against,
she has already relaxed the muscles enough for him to pull them open.
She needs to squeeze them tighter to demonstrate the strength she has in
the orbicular oculi.

The medulla is where the accessory nerve, which controls the
sternocleidomastoid muscle, and the hypoglossal nerve, which controls
the genioglossus muscle, are both located. The weakness of the left side
of the neck, and the tendency of the tongue to point to that side, both
show that the damage is on the left side of the brain stem.
