The term <span data-type="term">tissue</span> is used to describe a
group of cells found together in the body. The cells within a tissue
share a common embryonic origin. Microscopic observation reveals that
the cells in a tissue share morphological features and are arranged in
an orderly pattern that achieves the tissue’s functions. From the
evolutionary perspective, tissues appear in more complex organisms. For
example, multicellular protists, ancient eukaryotes, do not have cells
organized into tissues.

Although there are many types of cells in the human body, they are
organized into four broad categories of tissues: epithelial, connective,
muscle, and nervous. Each of these categories is characterized by
specific functions that contribute to the overall health and maintenance
of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or
disease. Such changes can be detected through <span
data-type="term">histology</span>, the microscopic study of tissue
appearance, organization, and function.

# The Four Types of Tissues
{: data-type="title"}

<span data-type="term">Epithelial tissue</span>, also referred to as
epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces
of the body, lines internal cavities and passageways, and forms certain
glands. <span data-type="term">Connective tissue</span>, as its name
implies, binds the cells and organs of the body together and functions
in the protection, support, and integration of all parts of the body.
<span data-type="term">Muscle tissue</span> is excitable, responding to
stimulation and contracting to provide movement, and occurs as three
major types: skeletal (voluntary) muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac
muscle in the heart. <span data-type="term">Nervous tissue</span> is
also excitable, allowing the propagation of electrochemical signals in
the form of nerve impulses that communicate between different regions of
the body ([\[link\]](#fig-ch04_01_01){: .autogenerated-content}).
{: #fs-id1312224}

The next level of organization is the organ, where several types of
tissues come together to form a working unit. Just as knowing the
structure and function of cells helps you in your study of tissues,
knowledge of tissues will help you understand how organs function. The
epithelial and connective tissues are discussed in detail in this
chapter. Muscle and nervous tissues will be discussed only briefly in
this chapter.

# Embryonic Origin of Tissues
{: data-type="title"}

The zygote, or fertilized egg, is a single cell formed by the fusion of
an egg and sperm. After fertilization the zygote gives rise to rapid
mitotic cycles, generating many cells to form the embryo. The first
embryonic cells generated have the ability to differentiate into any
type of cell in the body and, as such, are called <span
data-type="term">totipotent</span>, meaning each has the capacity to
divide, differentiate, and develop into a new organism. As cell
proliferation progresses, three major cell lineages are established
within the embryo. Each of these lineages of embryonic cells forms the
distinct germ layers from which all the tissues and organs of the human
body eventually form. Each germ layer is identified by its relative
position: <span data-type="term">ectoderm</span> (ecto- = “outer”),
<span data-type="term">mesoderm</span> (meso- = “middle”), and <span
data-type="term">endoderm</span> (endo- = “inner”).
[\[link\]](#fig-ch04_01_02){: .autogenerated-content} shows the types of
tissues and organs associated with the each of the three germ layers.
Note that epithelial tissue originates in all three layers, whereas
nervous tissue derives primarily from the ectoderm and muscle tissue
from mesoderm.

A <span data-type="term">tissue membrane</span> is a thin layer or sheet
of cells that covers the outside of the body (for example, skin), the
organs (for example, pericardium), internal passageways that lead to the
exterior of the body (for example, abdominal mesenteries), and the
lining of the moveable joint cavities. There are two basic types of
tissue membranes: connective tissue and epithelial membranes

## Connective Tissue Membranes
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">connective tissue membrane</span> is formed
solely from connective tissue. These membranes encapsulate organs, such
as the kidneys, and line our movable joints. A <span
data-type="term">synovial membrane</span> is a type of connective tissue
membrane that lines the cavity of a freely movable joint. For example,
synovial membranes surround the joints of the shoulder, elbow, and knee.
Fibroblasts in the inner layer of the synovial membrane release
hyaluronan into the joint cavity. The hyaluronan effectively traps
available water to form the synovial fluid, a natural lubricant that
enables the bones of a joint to move freely against one another without
much friction. This synovial fluid readily exchanges water and nutrients
with blood, as do all body fluids.

## Epithelial Membranes
{: data-type="title"}

The <span data-type="term">epithelial membrane</span> is composed of
epithelium attached to a layer of connective tissue, for example, your
skin. The <span data-type="term">mucous membrane</span> is also a
composite of connective and epithelial tissues. Sometimes called
mucosae, these epithelial membranes line the body cavities and hollow
passageways that open to the external environment, and include the
digestive, respiratory, excretory, and reproductive tracts. Mucous,
produced by the epithelial exocrine glands, covers the epithelial layer.
The underlying connective tissue, called the <span
data-type="term">lamina propria</span> (literally “own layer”), help
support the fragile epithelial layer.
{: #fs-id1522633}

A <span data-type="term">serous membrane</span> is an epithelial
membrane composed of mesodermally derived epithelium called the
mesothelium that is supported by connective tissue. These membranes line
the coelomic cavities of the body, that is, those cavities that do not
open to the outside, and they cover the organs located within those
cavities. They are essentially membranous bags, with mesothelium lining
the inside and connective tissue on the outside. Serous fluid secreted
by the cells of the thin squamous mesothelium lubricates the membrane
and reduces abrasion and friction between organs. Serous membranes are
identified according locations. Three serous membranes line the thoracic
cavity; the two pleura that cover the lungs and the pericardium that
covers the heart. A fourth, the peritoneum, is the serous membrane in
the abdominal cavity that covers abdominal organs and forms double
sheets of mesenteries that suspend many of the digestive organs.
{: #fs-id1110348}

The skin is an epithelial membrane also called the <span
data-type="term">cutaneous membrane</span>. It is a stratified squamous
epithelial membrane resting on top of connective tissue. The apical
surface of this membrane is exposed to the external environment and is
covered with dead, keratinized cells that help protect the body from
desiccation and pathogens.

# Chapter Review
{: data-type="title"}

The human body contains more than 200 types of cells that can all be
classified into four types of tissues: epithelial, connective, muscle,
and nervous. Epithelial tissues act as coverings controlling the
movement of materials across the surface. Connective tissue integrates
the various parts of the body and provides support and protection to
organs. Muscle tissue allows the body to move. Nervous tissues propagate
information.
{: #fs-id1466200}

The study of the shape and arrangement of cells in tissue is called
histology. All cells and tissues in the body derive from three germ
layers in the embryo: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.
{: #fs-id1315197}

Different types of tissues form membranes that enclose organs, provide a
friction-free interaction between organs, and keep organs together.
Synovial membranes are connective tissue membranes that protect and line
the joints. Epithelial membranes are formed from epithelial tissue
attached to a layer of connective tissue. There are three types of
epithelial membranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous, which
secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the skin.

The four types of tissue in the body are epithelial, connective, muscle,
and nervous. Epithelial tissue is made of layers of cells that cover the
surfaces of the body that come into contact with the exterior world,
line internal cavities, and form glands. Connective tissue binds the
cells and organs of the body together and performs many functions,
especially in the protection, support, and integration of the body.
Muscle tissue, which responds to stimulation and contracts to provide
movement, is divided into three major types: skeletal (voluntary)
muscles, smooth muscles, and the cardiac muscle in the heart. Nervous
tissue allows the body to receive signals and transmit information as
electric impulses from one region of the body to another.

The zygote divides into many cells. As these cells become specialized,
they lose their ability to differentiate into all tissues. At first they
form the three primary germ layers. Following the cells of the
ectodermal germ layer, they too become more restricted in what they can
form. Ultimately, some of these ectodermal cells become further
restricted and differentiate in to nerve cells.
