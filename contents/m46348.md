The axial skeleton begins to form during early embryonic development.
However, growth, remodeling, and ossification (bone formation) continue
for several decades after birth before the adult skeleton is fully
formed. Knowledge of the developmental processes that give rise to the
skeleton is important for understanding the abnormalities that may arise
in skeletal structures.

# Development of the Skull

During the third week of embryonic development, a rod-like structure
called the <span data-type="term">notochord</span> develops dorsally
along the length of the embryo. The tissue overlying the notochord
enlarges and forms the neural tube, which will give rise to the brain
and spinal cord. By the fourth week, mesoderm tissue located on either
side of the notochord thickens and separates into a repeating series of
block-like tissue structures, each of which is called a <span
data-type="term">somite</span>. As the somites enlarge, each one will
split into several parts. The most medial of these parts is called a
<span data-type="term">sclerotome</span>. The sclerotomes consist of an
embryonic tissue called mesenchyme, which will give rise to the fibrous
connective tissues, cartilages, and bones of the body.

The bones of the skull arise from mesenchyme during embryonic
development in two different ways. The first mechanism produces the
bones that form the top and sides of the brain case. This involves the
local accumulation of mesenchymal cells at the site of the future bone.
These cells then differentiate directly into bone producing cells, which
form the skull bones through the process of intramembranous
ossification. As the brain case bones grow in the fetal skull, they
remain separated from each other by large areas of dense connective
tissue, each of which is called a <span
data-type="term">fontanelle</span> ([\[link\]](#fig-ch07_05_01){:
.autogenerated-content}). The fontanelles are the soft spots on an
infant’s head. They are important during birth because these areas allow
the skull to change shape as it squeezes through the birth canal. After
birth, the fontanelles allow for continued growth and expansion of the
skull as the brain enlarges. The largest fontanelle is located on the
anterior head, at the junction of the frontal and parietal bones. The
fontanelles decrease in size and disappear by age 2. However, the skull
bones remained separated from each other at the sutures, which contain
dense fibrous connective tissue that unites the adjacent bones. The
connective tissue of the sutures allows for continued growth of the
skull bones as the brain enlarges during childhood growth.

The second mechanism for bone development in the skull produces the
facial bones and floor of the brain case. This also begins with the
localized accumulation of mesenchymal cells. However, these cells
differentiate into cartilage cells, which produce a hyaline cartilage
model of the future bone. As this cartilage model grows, it is gradually
converted into bone through the process of endochondral ossification.
This is a slow process and the cartilage is not completely converted to
bone until the skull achieves its full adult size.

At birth, the brain case and orbits of the skull are disproportionally
large compared to the bones of the jaws and lower face. This reflects
the relative underdevelopment of the maxilla and mandible, which lack
teeth, and the small sizes of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity.
During early childhood, the mastoid process enlarges, the two halves of
the mandible and frontal bone fuse together to form single bones, and
the paranasal sinuses enlarge. The jaws also expand as the teeth begin
to appear. These changes all contribute to the rapid growth and
enlargement of the face during childhood.

# Development of the Vertebral Column and Thoracic cage

Development of the vertebrae begins with the accumulation of mesenchyme
cells from each sclerotome around the notochord. These cells
differentiate into a hyaline cartilage model for each vertebra, which
then grow and eventually ossify into bone through the process of
endochondral ossification. As the developing vertebrae grow, the
notochord largely disappears. However, small areas of notochord tissue
persist between the adjacent vertebrae and this contributes to the
formation of each intervertebral disc.

The ribs and sternum also develop from mesenchyme. The ribs initially
develop as part of the cartilage model for each vertebra, but in the
thorax region, the rib portion separates from the vertebra by the eighth
week. The cartilage model of the rib then ossifies, except for the
anterior portion, which remains as the costal cartilage. The sternum
initially forms as paired hyaline cartilage models on either side of the
anterior midline, beginning during the fifth week of development. The
cartilage models of the ribs become attached to the lateral sides of the
developing sternum. Eventually, the two halves of the cartilaginous
sternum fuse together along the midline and then ossify into bone. The
manubrium and body of the sternum are converted into bone first, with
the xiphoid process remaining as cartilage until late in life.

<span data-type="title">Craniosynostosis</span> The premature closure
(fusion) of a suture line is a condition called craniosynostosis. This
error in the normal developmental process results in abnormal growth of
the skull and deformity of the head. It is produced either by defects in
the ossification process of the skull bones or failure of the brain to
properly enlarge. Genetic factors are involved, but the underlying cause
is unknown. It is a relatively common condition, occurring in
approximately 1:2000 births, with males being more commonly affected.
Primary craniosynostosis involves the early fusion of one cranial
suture, whereas complex craniosynostosis results from the premature
fusion of several sutures.

The early fusion of a suture in primary craniosynostosis prevents any
additional enlargement of the cranial bones and skull along this line.
Continued growth of the brain and skull is therefore diverted to other
areas of the head, causing an abnormal enlargement of these regions. For
example, the early disappearance of the anterior fontanelle and
premature closure of the sagittal suture prevents growth across the top
of the head. This is compensated by upward growth by the bones of the
lateral skull, resulting in a long, narrow, wedge-shaped head. This
condition, known as scaphocephaly, accounts for approximately 50 percent
of craniosynostosis abnormalities. Although the skull is misshapen, the
brain still has adequate room to grow and thus there is no accompanying
abnormal neurological development.

In cases of complex craniosynostosis, several sutures close prematurely.
The amount and degree of skull deformity is determined by the location
and extent of the sutures involved. This results in more severe
constraints on skull growth, which can alter or impede proper brain
growth and development.

Cases of craniosynostosis are usually treated with surgery. A team of
physicians will open the skull along the fused suture, which will then
allow the skull bones to resume their growth in this area. In some
cases, parts of the skull will be removed and replaced with an
artificial plate. The earlier after birth that surgery is performed, the
better the outcome. After treatment, most children continue to grow and
develop normally and do not exhibit any neurological problems.

# Chapter Review

Formation of the axial skeleton begins during early embryonic
development with the appearance of the rod-like notochord along the
dorsal length of the early embryo. Repeating, paired blocks of tissue
called somites then appear along either side of notochord. As the
somites grow, they split into parts, one of which is called a
sclerotome. This consists of mesenchyme, the embryonic tissue that will
become the bones, cartilages, and connective tissues of the body.

Mesenchyme in the head region will produce the bones of the skull via
two different mechanisms. The bones of the brain case arise via
intramembranous ossification in which embryonic mesenchyme tissue
converts directly into bone. At the time of birth, these bones are
separated by fontanelles, wide areas of fibrous connective tissue. As
the bones grow, the fontanelles are reduced to sutures, which allow for
continued growth of the skull throughout childhood. In contrast, the
cranial base and facial bones are produced by the process of
endochondral ossification, in which mesenchyme tissue initially produces
a hyaline cartilage model of the future bone. The cartilage model allows
for growth of the bone and is gradually converted into bone over a
period of many years.

The vertebrae, ribs, and sternum also develop via endochondral
ossification. Mesenchyme accumulates around the notochord and produces
hyaline cartilage models of the vertebrae. The notochord largely
disappears, but remnants of the notochord contribute to formation of the
intervertebral discs. In the thorax region, a portion of the vertebral
cartilage model splits off to form the ribs. These then become attached
anteriorly to the developing cartilage model of the sternum. Growth of
the cartilage models for the vertebrae, ribs, and sternum allow for
enlargement of the thoracic cage during childhood and adolescence. The
cartilage models gradually undergo ossification and are converted into
bone.

# Critical Thinking Questions

<div data-type="problem" markdown="1">
Discuss the processes by which the brain-case bones of the skull are
formed and grow during skull enlargement.

</div>
<div data-type="solution" markdown="1">
The brain-case bones that form the top and sides of the skull are
produced by intramembranous ossification. In this, mesenchyme from the
sclerotome portion of the somites accumulates at the site of the future
bone and differentiates into bone-producing cells. These generate areas
of bone that are initially separated by wide regions of fibrous
connective tissue called fontanelles. After birth, as the bones enlarge,
the fontanelles disappear. However, the bones remain separated by the
sutures, where bone and skull growth can continue until the adult size
is obtained.

skull.

</div>
<div data-type="solution" markdown="1">
The facial bones and base of the skull arise via the process of
endochondral ossification. This process begins with the localized
accumulation of mesenchyme tissue at the sites of the future bones. The
mesenchyme differentiates into hyaline cartilage, which forms a
cartilage model of the future bone. The cartilage allows for growth and
enlargement of the model. It is gradually converted into bone over time.

Discuss the development of the vertebrae, ribs, and sternum.

</div>
<div data-type="solution" markdown="1">
The vertebrae, ribs, and sternum all develop via the process of
endochondral ossification. Mesenchyme tissue from the sclerotome portion
of the somites accumulates on either side of the notochord and produces
hyaline cartilage models for each vertebra. In the thorax region, a
portion of this cartilage model splits off to form the ribs. Similarly,
mesenchyme forms cartilage models for the right and left halves of the
sternum. The ribs then become attached anteriorly to the developing
sternum, and the two halves of sternum fuse together. Ossification of
the cartilage model into bone occurs within these structures over time.
This process continues until each is converted into bone, except for the
sternal ends of the ribs, which remain as the costal cartilages.
